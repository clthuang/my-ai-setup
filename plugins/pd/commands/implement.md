# /pd:implement

Contract command. Shared mechanics: workflow-transitions skill. Execution mechanics (worktree parallel dispatch): implementing skill.

**Purpose:** turn `plan.md` into working, verified code on the feature branch.

**Inputs:** `plan.md` tasks and `shape.md` contracts (deep) — or the `get_mini_spec` text (express: no artifacts exist); engine phase state.

**Steps:**
1. Engine entry `target_phase="implement"` — express features pass the skip set handed over by create-feature as `skipped_phases`; deep features pass none. Express detection from here on: `get_mini_spec` resolves.
2. Gate: `bash scripts/phase-gate.sh implement {feature-dir}` — append `--express` when `get_mini_spec` resolves.
3. Deep: execute tasks in plan order — parallel-safe tasks dispatch to implementer agents in `.pd-worktrees/` isolation (implementing skill); single-thread work stays inline. Express: the mini-spec text is the plan — implement directly against it. Every task ends with its verification command run green and a commit.
4. **QA moment (execution-grounded, FR-5):** dispatch `pd:qa-executor` — it RUNS the suites and drives the affected flows end-to-end, returning commands + output as evidence. Express mode: this pass is the combined QA+review and step 5 is skipped.
5. **Review moment (2 of 2):** dispatch `pd:code-quality-reviewer` on the full branch diff (fresh context; findings cite file:line; return schema in the agent file). One pass → at most one fix round → remaining blockers escalate to the user.
6. Circuit breaker: one bounded breaker for the whole phase — 3 fix cycles total; the final validation run does not count toward it. Tripping stops execution with a summary.
7. Engine exit. Code and tests are the artifact; there is no implementation log.

**Constraints:** implementer prompts carry task-scoped contracts and pointers, never state dumps; non-trivial logic lands with a test asserting a fact true only on the new path; a clean QA + review pass ends the phase — no second full-review round exists.
