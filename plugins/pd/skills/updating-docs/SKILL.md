# Updating Docs

## Component sync checklist
Adding, removing, or renaming a plugin component means updating each line below in the same change. These counts and tables have drifted silently across past features; walk the list rather than guessing which entries moved.

- **Repo `README.md`** — skill, agent, and command tables plus their headline counts.
- **Repo `README_FOR_DEV.md`** — the same tables and counts, plus the hooks table when a hook is added or removed.
- **Plugin `README.md`** — component-count table and the command and agent tables.
- **Plugin `skills/workflow-state/SKILL.md`** — the single phase-sequence line, when phase names change.
- **Plugin `commands/secretary.md`** — the specialist fast-path table, when an agent listed there is renamed.
- **Repo and plugin `README.md`** — the `/pd:doctor` check-count claims, when a doctor check is added or removed.
- **Repo `CHANGELOG.md`** — an entry under `## [Unreleased]` for user-visible changes only: new commands, skills, config options, behavior changes. Refactors, tests, and internal cleanups get no entry.

Verify each count by listing the files it claims to describe. Never adjust the previous number by hand.

## Project documentation
For user-facing documentation beyond the checklist, dispatch `pd:documentation-researcher` to find which documents the change touches, then `pd:documentation-writer` to write them. The researcher's report names the affected tier; one writer dispatch per tier, run sequentially.

Skip both dispatches when the change has no user-visible surface — this pass advises, it never blocks.
