# /iflow:finish-feature Command

Complete a feature and clean up.

## Config Variables
Use these values from session context (injected at session start):
- `{iflow_artifacts_root}` — root directory for feature artifacts (default: `docs`)
- `{iflow_base_branch}` — base branch for merges (default: `main`)
- `{iflow_release_script}` — path to release script (empty if not configured)

## YOLO Mode Overrides

If `[YOLO_MODE]` is active:
- Step 2a (tasks incomplete) → auto "Continue anyway"
- Step 2b (scaffold gate) → auto-select Skip
- Step 2b (researcher no_updates_needed + empty affected_tiers) → auto-select Skip
- Phase 4 (completion decision) → auto "Merge & Release (Recommended)" (or "Merge (Recommended)" if `{iflow_release_script}` is not configured)
- **Git merge failure:** STOP and report. Do NOT attempt to resolve merge conflicts
  autonomously. Output: "YOLO MODE STOPPED: Merge conflict on {iflow_base_branch}. Resolve manually,
  then run /secretary continue"

## Determine Feature

Same logic as /iflow:show-status command.

---

## Phase 1: Auto-Commit (with Branch/Phase Checks)

### Steps 1a-1c: Branch Check, Partial Recovery, Mark Started

Follow `validateAndSetup("finish")` from the **workflow-transitions** skill (skip transition validation since finish has no hard prerequisites).

### Step 1d: Commit and Push

1. Check for uncommitted changes via `git status --short`
2. If uncommitted changes found:
   - `git add -A && git commit -m "wip: uncommitted changes before finish"`
   - `git push`
   - On push failure: Show error and STOP - user must resolve manually
3. If no uncommitted changes: Continue

---

## Phase 2: Pre-Completion Reviews

### Step 2a: Check Tasks Completion

If `tasks.md` exists, check for incomplete tasks (unchecked `- [ ]` items).

If incomplete tasks found:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "{n} tasks still incomplete. How to proceed?",
    "header": "Tasks",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Continue anyway", "description": "Proceed despite incomplete tasks"},
      {"label": "Run /iflow:implement", "description": "Execute implementation once more"},
      {"label": "Run /iflow:implement until done", "description": "Loop until all tasks complete"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

If "Run /iflow:implement": Execute `/iflow:implement`, then return to Phase 2.
If "Run /iflow:implement until done": Loop `/iflow:implement` until no incomplete tasks, then continue.

### Step 2b: Documentation Update (Enriched)

#### Mode Resolution

<!-- SYNC: tier-resolution -->
1. Parse `iflow_doc_tiers` from session context — split on comma, trim whitespace, filter to recognized values (`user-guide`, `dev-guide`, `technical`). If `iflow_doc_tiers` is not set or empty, default to all three tiers.
2. For each recognized tier, check if `docs/{tier}/` exists (relative to project root).
3. If any enabled tier directory is missing → `mode = scaffold`. If all enabled tier directories exist → `mode = incremental`.

<!-- SYNC: enriched-doc-dispatch -->
#### Doc-Schema Resolution

4. Resolve doc-schema content: Glob `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow*/*/references/doc-schema.md` — use first match. Fallback (dev workspace): `plugins/iflow/references/doc-schema.md`.
5. Read the resolved file content, store as `{doc_schema_content}`.
6. Replace all occurrences of `{iflow_artifacts_root}` in `{doc_schema_content}` with the actual session value.

#### Scaffold UX Gate (scaffold mode only)

If `mode = scaffold`:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "Documentation scaffold needed — some tier directories are missing. How to proceed?",
    "header": "Documentation Scaffold",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Skip", "description": "Skip documentation scaffolding for now"},
      {"label": "Scaffold", "description": "Create missing tier directories and seed files"},
      {"label": "Defer", "description": "Skip scaffolding — handle later"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

If "Skip" or "Defer": Continue to Phase 3 (no documentation updates).
If "Scaffold": Continue with enriched documentation flow below.

**YOLO override:** Auto-select "Skip" (never auto-scaffold during finish-feature).

<!-- SYNC: enriched-doc-dispatch -->
#### Pre-Computed Git Timestamps

For each enabled tier, compute the last-modified timestamp from source paths:

- **user-guide:** `git log -1 --format=%aI -- README.md package.json setup.py pyproject.toml bin/`
- **dev-guide:** `git log -1 --format=%aI -- src/ test/ Makefile .github/ CONTRIBUTING.md docker-compose.yml`
- **technical:** `git log -1 --format=%aI -- src/ docs/technical/`

If any command returns empty, use `"no-source-commits"` for that tier. Store as JSON map:

```json
{
  "user-guide": "2026-02-25T10:30:00-05:00",
  "dev-guide": "no-source-commits",
  "technical": "2026-02-24T14:15:00-05:00"
}
```

<!-- SYNC: enriched-doc-dispatch -->
#### Researcher Dispatch

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Research documentation state for feature {id}-{slug}"
  subagent_type: iflow:documentation-researcher
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Research current documentation state for feature {id}-{slug}.

    Mode: {mode}
    Enabled tiers: {enabled_tiers}

    Feature context:
    - Git diff (staged + unstaged): {git diff output against base branch}
    - Recent commits: {git log --oneline -20}

    Doc-schema reference:
    {doc_schema_content}

    Pre-computed tier timestamps:
    {timestamps_json}

    Analyze which tiers need updates based on the feature changes and
    source-path timestamps. Return structured JSON with:
    - no_updates_needed: boolean
    - affected_tiers: list of tier names that need doc updates
    - findings: per-tier analysis of what changed and what docs need updating
```

#### Researcher Evaluation Gate

If researcher returns `no_updates_needed: true` AND `affected_tiers` is empty:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "Documentation researcher found no updates needed. Skip documentation?",
    "header": "Documentation",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Skip documentation", "description": "No documentation updates needed"},
      {"label": "Force update", "description": "Run documentation writer anyway"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

**YOLO override:** Auto-select "Skip documentation".

If "Skip documentation": Continue to Phase 3.

#### Writer Dispatch

Build writer context from: researcher findings + mode + enabled tiers + `{doc_schema_content}` + ADR context (read `design.md` if it exists in feature artifacts directory).

**Budget breakdown:**
- **Scaffold mode:** 1 researcher (done) + up to 3 tier writers (sequential, one per affected tier) + 1 README/CHANGELOG writer = 5 max dispatches
- **Incremental mode:** 1 researcher (done) + 1 tier writer (handles all affected tiers) + 1 README/CHANGELOG writer = 3 max dispatches

**Tier writer dispatch (scaffold mode — one per affected tier, sequential):**

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Write {tier} documentation for feature {id}-{slug}"
  subagent_type: iflow:documentation-writer
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Write documentation for the {tier} tier.

    Mode: scaffold
    Feature: {id}-{slug}
    Research findings: {researcher findings for this tier}
    Doc-schema: {doc_schema_content}
    ADR context: {design.md content if exists, else "none"}

    Create the docs/{tier}/ directory and seed files per doc-schema.
    Return summary of files created.
```

**Tier writer dispatch (incremental mode — single dispatch for all affected tiers):**

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Update documentation for feature {id}-{slug}"
  subagent_type: iflow:documentation-writer
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Update documentation for affected tiers.

    Mode: incremental
    Feature: {id}-{slug}
    Affected tiers: {affected_tiers}
    Research findings: {researcher findings}
    Doc-schema: {doc_schema_content}
    ADR context: {design.md content if exists, else "none"}

    Update existing docs in affected tier directories.
    Return summary of changes made.
```

<!-- SYNC: readme-changelog-dispatch -->
#### README/CHANGELOG Writer Dispatch

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Update README and CHANGELOG for feature {id}-{slug}"
  subagent_type: iflow:documentation-writer
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md based on feature changes.

    Feature: {id}-{slug}
    Research findings: {researcher findings}

    README.md:
    - Pay special attention to any drift_detected entries — components that
      exist on the filesystem but are missing from README.md (or vice versa).
    - Update README.md (root). If plugins/iflow/README.md exists (dev workspace),
      update it too.
    - Add missing entries to appropriate tables, remove stale entries,
      correct component count headers.

    CHANGELOG.md:
    - Add entries under the ## [Unreleased] section
    - Use Keep a Changelog categories: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed
    - Only include user-visible changes (new commands, skills, config options,
      behavior changes)
    - Skip internal refactoring, test additions, and code quality changes

    Return summary of changes made.
```

#### Documentation Commit

```bash
git add docs/ README.md CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "docs: update documentation"
git push
```

---

## Phase 3: Retrospective (Automatic)

Run retrospective automatically without asking permission.

### Step 3a: Run Retrospective

Follow the `retrospecting` skill, which handles:
1. Context bundle assembly (.meta.json, .review-history.md, git summary, artifact stats)
2. retro-facilitator agent dispatch (AORTA framework analysis)
3. retro.md generation
4. Knowledge bank updates
5. Commit

The skill includes graceful degradation — if retro-facilitator fails, it falls back to investigation-agent.

### Step 3b: CLAUDE.md Update

Capture session learnings into project CLAUDE.md.

**Dependency:** Requires `claude-md-management` plugin (from claude-plugins-official marketplace).

1. **Invoke skill:**
   Invoke the `claude-md-management:revise-claude-md` skill via the Skill tool.

2. **If skill unavailable** (plugin not installed):
   Log "claude-md-management plugin not installed, skipping CLAUDE.md update." and continue to Phase 4.

3. **If changes made:**
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md .claude.local.md 2>/dev/null
   git commit -m "chore: update CLAUDE.md with feature {id}-{slug} learnings" --allow-empty
   git push
   ```

---

## Phase 4: Completion Decision

Present only two options:

The option labels depend on whether `{iflow_release_script}` is configured:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "Feature {id}-{slug} complete. How would you like to finish?",
    "header": "Finish",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Merge & Release (Recommended)", "description": "Merge to {iflow_base_branch} and run release script"},
      // ↑ Use "Merge (Recommended)" and description "Merge to {iflow_base_branch}"
      //   if {iflow_release_script} is not configured
      {"label": "Create PR", "description": "Open pull request for team review"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

---

## Phase 5: Execute Selected Option

### Step 5a: Pre-Merge Validation

Before executing the selected option, discover and run project checks to catch issues while still on the feature branch.

**Discovery** — scan in this order, collecting checks from all matching categories:

1. **CI/CD config**: Glob for `.github/workflows/*.yml`. For each file, grep for `run:` lines that reference local scripts or common commands (e.g. `./validate.sh`, `npm test`, `npm run lint`). Deduplicate against checks already collected.
2. **Validation script**: Check if `validate.sh` exists at the project root. If found, add `./validate.sh`.
3. **Package.json scripts**: If `package.json` exists, read it and look for scripts named `test`, `lint`, `check`, or `validate`. For each found, add `npm run {name}`.
4. **Makefile**: If `Makefile` exists, grep for targets named `check`, `test`, `lint`, or `validate`. For each found, add `make {target}`.

Deduplicate: if the same underlying command appears via multiple discovery paths, run it only once.

If **no checks discovered**: Log "No project checks found — skipping pre-merge validation." and proceed.

**Execution loop** (max 3 attempts):

1. Run all discovered checks sequentially.
2. If all pass → proceed to the selected option below.
3. If any check fails:
   - Analyze the failure output and attempt to fix the issues automatically.
   - Commit fixes: `git add -A && git commit -m "fix: address pre-merge validation failures"`.
   - Re-run all checks (counts as next attempt).
4. If checks still fail after 3 attempts, STOP and inform the user:

```
Pre-merge validation failed after 3 attempts.

Still failing:
- {check command}: {brief error summary}

Fix these issues manually, then run /finish-feature again.
```

Do NOT proceed to Create PR or Merge & Release if validation is failing.

### If "Create PR":

```bash
git push -u origin feature/{id}-{slug}
gh pr create --title "Feature: {slug}" --body "## Summary
{Brief description from spec.md}

## Changes
{List of key changes}

## Testing
{Test instructions or 'See tasks.md'}"
```

Output: "PR created: {url}"
→ Continue to Phase 6

### If "Merge & Release" (or "Merge"):

```bash
# Merge to base branch
git checkout {iflow_base_branch}
git pull origin {iflow_base_branch}
git merge feature/{id}-{slug}
git push
```

If `{iflow_release_script}` is set and the file exists at that path, run it:
```bash
{iflow_release_script}
```
Otherwise, skip the release step and output "No release script configured."

Output: "Merged to {iflow_base_branch}." followed by "Release: v{version}" if release script ran, or "No release script configured." if not.
→ Continue to Phase 6

---

## Phase 6: Cleanup (Automatic)

Run automatically after Phase 5 completes.

### Step 6a: Update .meta.json

```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "completed": "{ISO timestamp}",
  "lastCompletedPhase": "finish",
  "phases": {
    "finish": {
      "status": "completed",
      "completed": "{ISO timestamp}"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6b: Delete temporary files

```bash
rm {iflow_artifacts_root}/features/{id}-{slug}/.review-history.md 2>/dev/null || true
rm {iflow_artifacts_root}/features/{id}-{slug}/implementation-log.md 2>/dev/null || true
```

### Step 6c: Delete Feature Branch

- After PR: Branch will be deleted when PR merged via GitHub
- After Merge & Release: `git branch -d feature/{id}-{slug}`

### Step 6d: Final Output

```
Feature {id}-{slug} completed
Retrospective saved to retro.md
Branch cleaned up
{PR created: {url} | Released v{version}}

Learnings captured in knowledge bank.
```
