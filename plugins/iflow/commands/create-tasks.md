description: Break down plan into actionable tasks
argument-hint: "[--feature=<id-slug>]"
---

Invoke the breaking-down-tasks skill for the current feature context.

## Config Variables
Use these values from session context (injected at session start):
- `{iflow_artifacts_root}` — root directory for feature artifacts (default: `docs`)

Read {iflow_artifacts_root}/features/ to find active feature, then follow the workflow below.

## Workflow Integration

### 1-3. Validate, Branch Check, Partial Recovery, Mark Started

Follow `validateAndSetup("create-tasks")` from the **workflow-transitions** skill.

**Hard prerequisite:** Before standard validation, validate plan.md using `validateArtifact(path, "plan.md")`. If validation fails:
```
BLOCKED: Valid plan.md required before task creation.

{Level 1}: plan.md not found. Run /iflow:create-plan first.
{Level 2}: plan.md appears empty or stub. Run /iflow:create-plan to complete it.
{Level 3}: plan.md missing markdown structure. Run /iflow:create-plan to fix.
{Level 4}: plan.md missing required sections (Implementation Order or Phase). Run /iflow:create-plan to add them.
```
Stop execution. Do not proceed.

### 4. Stage 1: Task Breakdown with Review Loop

Max iterations: 5.

**Resume state initialization:**
Initialize `resume_state = {}` at the start of the review loop. This dict tracks per-role agent context for resume across iterations. Keys: `"task-reviewer"`, `"phase-reviewer"`. Each entry: `{ agent_id, iteration1_prompt_length, last_iteration, last_commit_sha }`.

Execute this loop:

a. **Produce artifact:** Follow the breaking-down-tasks skill to create/revise tasks.md

b. **Invoke task-reviewer:**

   **PRD resolution (I8):** Before dispatching, resolve the PRD reference:
   1. Check if `{feature_path}/prd.md` exists
   2. If exists -> PRD line = `- PRD: {feature_path}/prd.md`
   3. If not -> check `.meta.json` for `brainstorm_source`
      a. If found -> PRD line = `- PRD: {brainstorm_source path}`
      b. If not -> PRD line = `- PRD: No PRD — feature created without brainstorm`

   **Dispatch decision for task-reviewer:**

   **If iteration == 1 OR resume_state["task-reviewer"] is missing/empty OR resume_state["task-reviewer"].agent_id is null** — use fresh I1-R4 dispatch:

   Use the Task tool:
   ```
   Task tool call:
     description: "Review task breakdown quality"
     subagent_type: iflow:task-reviewer
     model: sonnet
     prompt: |
       Review the task breakdown for quality and executability.

       ## Required Artifacts
       You MUST read the following files before beginning your review.
       After reading, confirm: "Files read: {name} ({N} lines), ..." in a single line.
       {resolved PRD line from I8}
       - Spec: {feature_path}/spec.md
       - Design: {feature_path}/design.md
       - Plan: {feature_path}/plan.md

       Validate:
       1. Plan fidelity - every plan item has tasks
       2. Task executability - any engineer can start immediately
       3. Task size - 5-15 min each
       4. Dependency accuracy - parallel groups correct
       5. Testability - binary done criteria

       Return your assessment as JSON:
       {
         "approved": true/false,
         "issues": [{"severity": "blocker|warning|suggestion", "task": "...", "description": "...", "suggestion": "..."}],
         "summary": "..."
       }

       ## Tasks (what you're reviewing)
       {content of tasks.md}
   ```
   (Fresh dispatch per iteration — Phase 1 behavior. Phase 2 design defines resume support.)

   After fresh dispatch: capture the `agent_id` from the Task tool result. Record the character count of the prompt above as `prompt_length`. Capture current HEAD SHA via `Bash: git rev-parse HEAD`. Store in resume_state:
   ```
   resume_state["task-reviewer"] = {
     "agent_id": {agent_id from Task result},
     "iteration1_prompt_length": {prompt_length} (only set on iteration 1; preserved on subsequent fresh dispatches),
     "last_iteration": {n},
     "last_commit_sha": {HEAD SHA}
   }
   ```
   If this is not iteration 1 (fresh dispatch due to fallback/reset), preserve the original `iteration1_prompt_length` from the first fresh dispatch of this loop if available; otherwise set it from this dispatch's prompt length.

   **If iteration >= 2 AND resume_state["task-reviewer"] exists with non-null agent_id** — attempt resumed dispatch:

   First, compute the delta. Run the unified three-state git command:
   ```
   Bash: git add {feature_path}/tasks.md && git diff --cached --quiet && echo NO_CHANGES || (git commit -m "iflow: tasks review iteration {n}" && echo COMMIT_OK || echo COMMIT_FAILED)
   ```

   Handle the three outcomes:

   - **NO_CHANGES**: No revisions were committed. Issue a fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to iteration {n}). Reset `resume_state["task-reviewer"]` so the fresh dispatch result becomes the new resume anchor. Do NOT use I3 fallback template. Do NOT reuse a prior delta.

   - **COMMIT_FAILED**: Git commit failed. Fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to iteration {n}). Reset `resume_state["task-reviewer"]`.

   - **COMMIT_OK**: Commit succeeded. Capture new SHA: `Bash: git rev-parse HEAD` -> `new_sha`. Compute delta:
     ```
     Bash: git diff {resume_state["task-reviewer"].last_commit_sha} HEAD -- {feature_path}/tasks.md
     ```
     Capture output as `delta_content`.

     **Delta size guard**: If `len(delta_content)` > 50% of `resume_state["task-reviewer"].iteration1_prompt_length`, the delta is too large — fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to iteration {n}). Reset `resume_state["task-reviewer"]`.

     **If delta is within threshold**, attempt resumed dispatch:
     ```
     Task tool call:
       resume: {resume_state["task-reviewer"].agent_id}
       prompt: |
         You already have the upstream artifacts and the previous version of
         tasks.md in context from your prior review.

         The following changes were made to address your previous issues:

         ## Delta
         {delta_content from git diff}

         ## Fix Summary
         {summary of revisions made to address the reviewer's issues}

         Review the changes above. Assess whether your previous issues are resolved
         and check for new issues introduced by the fixes.

         This is iteration {n} of {max}.

         Return your assessment as JSON:
         {
           "approved": true/false,
           "issues": [{"severity": "blocker|warning|suggestion", "task": "...", "description": "...", "suggestion": "..."}],
           "summary": "..."
         }
     ```

     **If resume succeeds**: Update resume_state:
     ```
     resume_state["task-reviewer"].agent_id = {agent_id from resumed Task result}
     resume_state["task-reviewer"].last_iteration = {n}
     resume_state["task-reviewer"].last_commit_sha = {new_sha}
     ```

     **If resume fails** (Task tool returns an error): Fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (I3 fallback — same template as iteration 1, with additional line in Iteration Context: `"(Fresh dispatch — prior review session unavailable.)"` and previous issues included). Log to `.review-history.md`: `RESUME-FALLBACK: task-reviewer iteration {n} — {error summary}`. Reset `resume_state["task-reviewer"]` with the new fresh dispatch's agent_id.

   **Context compaction detection**: Before attempting resume, if `resume_state["task-reviewer"]` was previously populated but `agent_id` is now null or missing (due to context compaction), treat as fresh I1-R4 dispatch. Log: `RESUME-FALLBACK: task-reviewer iteration {n} — agent_id lost (context compaction)`.

c. **Parse response:** Extract the `approved` field from reviewer's JSON response.
   - If response is not valid JSON, ask reviewer to retry with correct format.

   **Fallback detection (I9):** Search the agent's response for "Files read:" pattern. If not found, log `LAZY-LOAD-WARNING: task-reviewer did not confirm artifact reads` to `.review-history.md`. Proceed regardless. Note: Resumed dispatches (I2 template) do not include Required Artifacts, so "Files read:" may not appear — only apply I9 detection to fresh dispatches.

d. **Branch on result (strict threshold):**
   - **PASS:** `approved: true` AND zero issues with severity "blocker" or "warning"
   - **FAIL:** `approved: false` OR any issue has severity "blocker" or "warning"
   - If PASS -> Proceed to Stage 2 (step 5)
   - If FAIL AND iteration < max:
     - Append iteration to `.review-history.md` using format below
     - Increment iteration counter
     - Address all blocker AND warning issues by revising tasks.md
     - Return to step 4b (Fresh dispatch per iteration — Phase 1 behavior. Phase 2 design defines resume support.)
   - If FAIL AND iteration == max:
     - Note concerns in `.meta.json` taskReview.concerns
     - Proceed to Stage 2 (step 5)

**Review History Entry Format** (append to `.review-history.md`):
```markdown
## Task Review Iteration {n} - {ISO timestamp}

**Decision:** {Approved / Needs Revision}

**Issues:**
- [{severity}] {task}: {description} -> {suggestion}

**Changes Made:**
{Summary of revisions made to address issues}

---
```

### 5. Stage 2: Chain Validation (Handoff Gate)

Phase-reviewer iteration budget: max 5 (independent of Stage 1).

Set `phase_iteration = 0`.

After Stage 1 completes, invoke phase-reviewer (Fresh dispatch per iteration — Phase 1 behavior. Phase 2 design defines resume support.):

**PRD resolution (I8):** Before dispatching, resolve the PRD reference (same logic as Stage 1).

   **Dispatch decision for phase-reviewer:**

   **If phase_iteration == 1 OR resume_state["phase-reviewer"] is missing/empty OR resume_state["phase-reviewer"].agent_id is null** — use fresh I1-R4 dispatch:

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Validate tasks ready for implementation"
  subagent_type: iflow:phase-reviewer
  model: sonnet
  prompt: |
    Validate this task breakdown is ready for implementation.

    ## Required Artifacts
    You MUST read the following files before beginning your review.
    After reading, confirm: "Files read: {name} ({N} lines), ..." in a single line.
    {resolved PRD line from I8}
    - Spec: {feature_path}/spec.md
    - Design: {feature_path}/design.md
    - Plan: {feature_path}/plan.md
    - Tasks: {feature_path}/tasks.md

    ## Next Phase Expectations
    Implement needs: Small actionable tasks (<15 min each),
    clear acceptance criteria per task, dependency graph for parallel execution.

    Return your assessment as JSON:
    {
      "approved": true/false,
      "issues": [{"severity": "blocker|warning|suggestion", "description": "...", "location": "...", "suggestion": "..."}],
      "summary": "..."
    }

    ## Domain Reviewer Outcome
    - Reviewer: task-reviewer
    - Result: {APPROVED at iteration {n}/{max} | FAILED at iteration cap ({max}/{max})}
    - Unresolved issues: {list of remaining blocker/warning descriptions, or "none"}

    This is phase-review iteration {phase_iteration}/5.
```

   After fresh dispatch: capture the `agent_id` from the Task tool result. Record the character count of the prompt above as `prompt_length`. Capture current HEAD SHA via `Bash: git rev-parse HEAD`. Store in resume_state:
   ```
   resume_state["phase-reviewer"] = {
     "agent_id": {agent_id from Task result},
     "iteration1_prompt_length": {prompt_length} (only set on phase_iteration 1; preserved on subsequent fresh dispatches),
     "last_iteration": {phase_iteration},
     "last_commit_sha": {HEAD SHA}
   }
   ```
   If this is not phase_iteration 1 (fresh dispatch due to fallback/reset), preserve the original `iteration1_prompt_length` from the first fresh dispatch of this stage if available; otherwise set it from this dispatch's prompt length.

   **If phase_iteration >= 2 AND resume_state["phase-reviewer"] exists with non-null agent_id** — attempt resumed dispatch:

   First, compute the delta. Run the unified three-state git command:
   ```
   Bash: git add {feature_path}/tasks.md && git diff --cached --quiet && echo NO_CHANGES || (git commit -m "iflow: tasks chain review iteration {phase_iteration}" && echo COMMIT_OK || echo COMMIT_FAILED)
   ```

   Handle the three outcomes:

   - **NO_CHANGES**: No revisions were committed. Issue a fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as phase_iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to phase_iteration {phase_iteration}). Reset `resume_state["phase-reviewer"]` so the fresh dispatch result becomes the new resume anchor. Do NOT use I3 fallback template. Do NOT reuse a prior delta.

   - **COMMIT_FAILED**: Git commit failed. Fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as phase_iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to phase_iteration {phase_iteration}). Reset `resume_state["phase-reviewer"]`.

   - **COMMIT_OK**: Commit succeeded. Capture new SHA: `Bash: git rev-parse HEAD` -> `new_sha`. Compute delta:
     ```
     Bash: git diff {resume_state["phase-reviewer"].last_commit_sha} HEAD -- {feature_path}/tasks.md
     ```
     Capture output as `delta_content`.

     **Delta size guard**: If `len(delta_content)` > 50% of `resume_state["phase-reviewer"].iteration1_prompt_length`, the delta is too large — fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (same template as phase_iteration 1 above, with iteration context updated to phase_iteration {phase_iteration}). Reset `resume_state["phase-reviewer"]`.

     **If delta is within threshold**, attempt resumed dispatch:
     ```
     Task tool call:
       resume: {resume_state["phase-reviewer"].agent_id}
       prompt: |
         You already have the upstream artifacts and the previous version of
         tasks.md in context from your prior review.

         The following changes were made to address your previous issues:

         ## Delta
         {delta_content from git diff}

         ## Fix Summary
         {summary of revisions made to address the phase-reviewer's issues}

         Review the changes above. Assess whether your previous issues are resolved
         and check for new issues introduced by the fixes.

         This is phase-review iteration {phase_iteration}/5.

         Return your assessment as JSON:
         {
           "approved": true/false,
           "issues": [{"severity": "blocker|warning|suggestion", "description": "...", "location": "...", "suggestion": "..."}],
           "summary": "..."
         }
     ```

     **If resume succeeds**: Update resume_state:
     ```
     resume_state["phase-reviewer"].agent_id = {agent_id from resumed Task result}
     resume_state["phase-reviewer"].last_iteration = {phase_iteration}
     resume_state["phase-reviewer"].last_commit_sha = {new_sha}
     ```

     **If resume fails** (Task tool returns an error): Fall back to fresh I1-R4 dispatch (I3 fallback — same template as phase_iteration 1, with additional line after phase-review iteration line: `"(Fresh dispatch — prior review session unavailable.)"` and previous issues included). Log to `.review-history.md`: `RESUME-FALLBACK: phase-reviewer iteration {phase_iteration} — {error summary}`. Reset `resume_state["phase-reviewer"]` with the new fresh dispatch's agent_id.

   **Context compaction detection**: Before attempting resume, if `resume_state["phase-reviewer"]` was previously populated but `agent_id` is now null or missing (due to context compaction), treat as fresh I1-R4 dispatch. Log: `RESUME-FALLBACK: phase-reviewer iteration {phase_iteration} — agent_id lost (context compaction)`.

**Fallback detection (I9):** Search the agent's response for "Files read:" pattern. If not found, log `LAZY-LOAD-WARNING: phase-reviewer did not confirm artifact reads` to `.review-history.md`. Proceed regardless. Note: Resumed dispatches (I2 template) do not include Required Artifacts, so "Files read:" may not appear — only apply I9 detection to fresh dispatches.

**Branch on result (strict threshold):**
- **PASS:** `approved: true` AND zero issues with severity "blocker" or "warning"
- **FAIL:** `approved: false` OR any issue has severity "blocker" or "warning"
- If PASS -> Proceed to step 5b
- If FAIL AND phase_iteration < 5:
  - Append to `.review-history.md` with "Stage 2: Chain Review" marker
  - Increment phase_iteration
  - Address all blocker AND warning issues
  - Return to phase-reviewer invocation (Fresh dispatch per iteration — Phase 1 behavior. Phase 2 design defines resume support.)
- If FAIL AND phase_iteration == 5:
  - Store concerns in `.meta.json` chainReview.concerns
  - Proceed to step 5b with warning

### 5a. Capture Review Learnings (Automatic)

**Trigger:** Only execute if the review loop ran 2+ iterations (across Stage 1 and/or Stage 2 combined). If approved on first pass in both stages, skip — no review learnings to capture.

**Process:**
1. Read `.review-history.md` entries for THIS phase only (task-reviewer and phase-reviewer entries)
2. Group issues by description similarity (same category, overlapping file patterns)
3. Identify issues that appeared in 2+ iterations — these are recurring patterns

**For each recurring issue, call `store_memory`:**
- `name`: derived from issue description (max 60 chars)
- `description`: issue description + the suggestion that resolved it
- `reasoning`: "Recurred across {n} review iterations in feature {id} create-tasks phase"
- `category`: infer from issue type:
  - Security issues -> `anti-patterns`
  - Quality/SOLID/naming -> `heuristics`
  - Missing requirements -> `anti-patterns`
  - Feasibility/complexity -> `heuristics`
  - Scope/assumption issues -> `heuristics`
- `references`: ["feature/{id}-{slug}"]
- `confidence`: "low"

**Budget:** Max 3 entries per review cycle to avoid noise.

**Circuit breaker capture:** If review loop hit max iterations (cap reached) in either stage, also capture a single entry:
- `name`: "Task review cap: {brief issue category}"
- `description`: summary of unresolved issues that prevented approval
- `category`: "anti-patterns"
- `confidence`: "low"

**Fallback:** If `store_memory` MCP tool unavailable, use `semantic_memory.writer` CLI.

**Output:** `"Review learnings: {n} patterns captured from {m}-iteration review cycle"` (inline, no prompt)

### 5b. Auto-Commit and Update State

Follow `commitAndComplete("create-tasks", ["tasks.md"])` from the **workflow-transitions** skill.

Create-tasks additionally records taskReview and chainReview sub-objects in the phase state.

### 7. Completion Message and Next Step

Output: "Tasks created. {n} tasks across {m} phases, {p} parallel groups."

**YOLO Mode:** If `[YOLO_MODE]` is active, skip the AskUserQuestion and directly invoke
`/iflow:implement` with `[YOLO_MODE]` in args.

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "Tasks complete. Continue to next phase?",
    "header": "Next Step",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Continue to /iflow:implement (Recommended)", "description": "Start implementation"},
      {"label": "Review tasks.md first", "description": "Inspect the tasks before continuing"},
      {"label": "Fix and rerun reviews", "description": "Apply fixes then rerun Stage 1 + Stage 2 review cycle"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

If "Continue to /iflow:implement (Recommended)": Invoke `/iflow:implement`
If "Review tasks.md first": Show "Tasks at {path}/tasks.md. Run /iflow:implement when ready." -> STOP
If "Fix and rerun reviews": Ask user what needs fixing (plain text via AskUserQuestion with free-text), apply the requested changes to tasks.md, then reset `resume_state = {}` (clear all entries — the user has made manual edits outside the review loop, so prior agent contexts are stale) and return to Step 4 (Stage 1 task-reviewer) with iteration counters reset to 0.
