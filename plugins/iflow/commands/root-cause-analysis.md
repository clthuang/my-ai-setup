# Root Cause Analysis Command

Invoke the root-cause-analysis skill and dispatch the rca-investigator agent.

## Get Bug Description

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it as the bug description.

If $ARGUMENTS is empty, prompt the user:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "What bug or failure would you like to investigate?",
    "header": "Bug Description",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Test failure", "description": "A test is failing with an error"},
      {"label": "Runtime error", "description": "Application throws an error"},
      {"label": "Unexpected behavior", "description": "Something works incorrectly"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

After selection, ask for details: "Please describe the specific error or behavior."

## Load Skill

Read the RCA skill: Glob `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow*/*/skills/root-cause-analysis/SKILL.md` — read first match.
Fallback: Read `plugins/iflow/skills/root-cause-analysis/SKILL.md` (dev workspace).
If not found: proceed with general RCA methodology.

## Dispatch Agent

Use the Task tool to dispatch the rca-investigator agent:

```
Task tool call:
  description: "Investigate root causes"
  subagent_type: iflow:rca-investigator
  prompt: |
    Investigate this bug/failure:

    {bug description from $ARGUMENTS or user input}

    Follow the 6-phase RCA process. Generate a report at docs/rca/.
```

## Capture Learnings (REQUIRED)

You MUST capture learnings before presenting handoff options. This is not optional.

### Extract and Persist

1. Glob `docs/rca/*.md` and read the most recently modified report
2. For each **root cause** (primary + contributing factors):
   - Call `store_memory` with:
     - `name`: concise title (max 60 chars)
     - `description`: full root cause description with evidence
     - `reasoning`: "Root cause discovered during RCA: {bug summary}"
     - `category`: "anti-patterns"
     - `references`: ["{report-path}"]
     - `confidence`: "medium" for primary cause, "low" for contributing factors
3. For each **recommendation**:
   - Call `store_memory` with:
     - `name`: concise recommendation title (max 60 chars)
     - `description`: full recommendation text
     - `reasoning`: "Prevention strategy from RCA: {bug summary}"
     - `category`: "heuristics"
     - `references`: ["{report-path}"]
     - `confidence`: "low"

### Quality Filter
- Skip entries that are purely feature-specific (e.g., "add field X to table Y")
- Only capture generalizable learnings (e.g., "validate schema migrations with version tracking")
- Max 5 entries per RCA to avoid noise

### Fallback
If `store_memory` MCP tool unavailable, use CLI:
```bash
# Find plugin Python + library
PLUGIN_ROOT=$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow*/*/hooks 2>/dev/null | head -1 | xargs dirname)
if [[ -n "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]] && [[ -x "$PLUGIN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" ]]; then
  PYTHONPATH="$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lib" "$PLUGIN_ROOT/.venv/bin/python" -m semantic_memory.writer \
    --action upsert --global-store ~/.claude/iflow/memory \
    --entry-json '{...}'
else
  # Fallback: dev workspace
  PYTHONPATH=plugins/iflow/hooks/lib python3 -m semantic_memory.writer \
    --action upsert --global-store ~/.claude/iflow/memory \
    --entry-json '{...}'
fi
```

### Output
```
RCA learnings captured: {n} anti-patterns, {m} heuristics
```

## On Completion

After the agent completes the RCA, offer handoff options:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    "question": "RCA complete. What would you like to do?",
    "header": "Next Step",
    "options": [
      {"label": "Create feature for fix", "description": "Start /create-feature with RCA findings"},
      {"label": "Save and exit", "description": "Keep report, end session"}
    ],
    "multiSelect": false
  }]
```

**If "Create feature for fix":**
1. Extract the title from the RCA report
2. Invoke: `/create-feature "Fix: {rca-title}"`
3. Display: "RCA report available at: {report-path} - reference for Problem Statement"

**If "Save and exit":**
1. Display: "RCA report saved to {report-path}"
2. End the workflow
