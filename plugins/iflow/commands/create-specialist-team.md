Display brief usage:
```
Usage: /iflow:create-specialist-team <task description>

Creates an ephemeral team of specialists to analyze or implement a complex task.

Examples:
  /iflow:create-specialist-team "analyze auth security and suggest improvements"
  /iflow:create-specialist-team "research caching strategies for our API"
  /iflow:create-specialist-team "implement and test a rate limiter"
```

## Main Flow

### Step 1: Analyze Task

Parse the task description to determine:

1. **Domains** — what areas of expertise are needed (security, performance, testing, etc.)
2. **Capabilities** — what tools are required (read-only analysis vs implementation)
3. **Team size** — how many specialists (cap at 5)
4. **Coordination pattern**:
   - **Sequential pipeline** — output of one feeds into next (e.g., analyze → implement → test)
   - **Parallel fan-out** — independent specialists working simultaneously (e.g., security + performance + quality review)

### Step 2: Select Templates and Confirm

Available templates (locate via two-location Glob: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow*/*/skills/creating-specialist-teams/references/`, fallback `plugins/*/skills/creating-specialist-teams/references/`):

| Template | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| `code-analyzer.template.md` | Read-only code analysis, pattern detection, structural findings |
| `research-specialist.template.md` | Evidence gathering, best practices research, comparisons |
| `implementation-specialist.template.md` | Writing code with TDD, making changes |
| `domain-expert.template.md` | Advisory analysis, architectural recommendations |
| `test-specialist.template.md` | Test coverage, edge cases, test implementation |

Map task domains to templates. Assign specific focus areas to each specialist.

**Present team for approval:**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    question: "Proposed team for '{task}'. Deploy?",
    header: "Team",
    options: [
      { label: "Deploy", description: "{n} specialists: {list with roles}" },
      { label: "Customize", description: "Modify team composition" },
      { label: "Cancel", description: "Abort" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
```

**If user selects "Customize":**
```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    question: "Select specialists for this team:",
    header: "Customize",
    options: [
      { label: "Code Analyzer", description: "Read-only analysis of codebase patterns" },
      { label: "Research Specialist", description: "Web research for best practices" },
      { label: "Implementation Specialist", description: "Write code with TDD" },
      { label: "Domain Expert", description: "Advisory recommendations" }
    ],
    multiSelect: true
  }]
```
Then re-confirm the customized team.

**YOLO override:** If args contain `[YOLO_MODE]`, skip team approval and auto-deploy recommended team.

### Step 3: Inject Context

For each selected template:

1. Read the scaffold template via two-location Glob:
   ```
   Glob ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow*/*/skills/creating-specialist-teams/references/{type}.template.md — read first match.
   Fallback: Read plugins/iflow/skills/creating-specialist-teams/references/{type}.template.md (dev workspace).
   ```

2. Gather codebase context relevant to the task:
   - Glob for files related to the task keywords
   - Grep for relevant code patterns
   - Limit context to most relevant 10-15 files

3. Gather workflow context:
   - Glob for `{iflow_artifacts_root}/features/*/.meta.json`
   - Find the active feature (`"status": "active"`)
     - If multiple active features: use highest ID number, log warning
   - If found: extract id, slug, lastCompletedPhase, mode; determine next phase
     using the canonical phase sequence (matches .meta.json values):
       brainstorm → specify → design → create-plan → create-tasks → implement → finish
     Check which artifacts exist (prd.md, spec.md, design.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
   - Format as:
     ```
     Active feature: {id}-{slug} ({mode} mode)
     Current phase: {lastCompletedPhase}
     Next phase: {next phase}
     Artifacts: {comma-separated existing artifacts}
     Directory: {iflow_artifacts_root}/features/{id}-{slug}/
     ```
   - If no active feature: "No active feature workflow. Specialist output is standalone."
   - If gathering fails (Glob error, malformed JSON): "Workflow context unavailable."

4. Fill template placeholders:
   - `{TASK_DESCRIPTION}` — the specific assignment for this specialist
   - `{CODEBASE_CONTEXT}` — relevant files and patterns found
   - `{WORKFLOW_CONTEXT}` — workflow state gathered in step 3
   - `{SUCCESS_CRITERIA}` — what constitutes successful output
   - `{OUTPUT_FORMAT}` — structured format for findings
   - `{SCOPE_BOUNDARIES}` — what the specialist should NOT do

### Step 4: Deploy Specialists

Dispatch each specialist via generic-worker:

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "iflow:generic-worker",
  model: "opus",
  description: "{role}: {brief assignment}",
  prompt: "{filled template content}"
})
```

**Coordination patterns:**
- **Parallel fan-out**: Dispatch specialists in batches of `max_concurrent_agents` (from session context, default 5). If team size exceeds the limit, dispatch in waves — wait for each wave to complete before the next.
- **Sequential pipeline**: Dispatch first specialist, wait for result, include result in next specialist's context

### Step 5: Synthesize Results

After all specialists complete:

1. Collect outputs from all specialists
2. Present combined results:

```
## Specialist Team Results

### Task: {original description}
### Team: {list of specialists}

{For each specialist:}
#### {Role} Findings
{specialist output}

---

### Synthesis
{Brief summary of key findings across all specialists}

### Recommended Next Steps
{Actionable follow-ups based on combined findings}
```

3. **Assess workflow routing** — determine which workflow phase matches the specialist outputs:

   Read active feature state (Glob `{iflow_artifacts_root}/features/*/.meta.json`, find `"status": "active"`).

   **Phase-to-command mapping** (use phase names for sequence comparisons; command names only at dispatch time):

   | Phase name (.meta.json) | Command (Skill dispatch) |
   |------------------------|--------------------------|
   | brainstorm | iflow:brainstorm |
   | specify | iflow:specify |
   | design | iflow:design |
   | create-plan | iflow:create-plan |
   | create-tasks | iflow:create-tasks |
   | implement | iflow:implement |
   | finish | iflow:finish-feature |

   #### If no active feature:
   | Output signals | Recommended action |
   |---------------|-------------------|
   | Research/exploration findings, problem framing | `/brainstorm` — seed brainstorm with findings |
   | Detailed requirements, acceptance criteria | `/create-feature` — findings are specified enough |
   | Code fixes already implemented | Done — standalone fix, no feature needed |
   | General analysis | `/brainstorm` — formalize into a feature |

   #### If active feature exists:
   Determine next phase from `lastCompletedPhase`. Check if specialist output aligns:

   | Output signals | Suggested phase (.meta.json name) |
   |---------------|----------------------------------|
   | Research, trade-off analysis, recommendations | `specify` (if brainstorm done) |
   | Requirements, acceptance criteria, success criteria | `specify` |
   | Architecture, components, interfaces, contracts | `design` |
   | Prioritized action items, implementation plan | `create-plan` |
   | Code changes, tests added, implementation complete | `implement` (continue) or `finish` |
   | Coverage gaps, test results | `implement` (address gaps) |

   If the suggested phase is later than next phase in the sequence, recommend next phase instead
   (prerequisites must be satisfied first). When output matches multiple categories, prefer the
   phase closest to the next phase in the sequence — this minimizes phase-skipping.

4. **Present workflow-aware follow-up:**

```
AskUserQuestion:
  questions: [{
    question: "What would you like to do with these results?",
    header: "Follow-up",
    options: [
      { label: "Continue to /{recommended-phase}", description: "{reason} (Recommended)" },
      { label: "Deep dive", description: "Investigate specific findings further" },
      { label: "Done", description: "Results are sufficient" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
```

   If user selects the recommended phase:
     `Skill({ skill: "iflow:{phase-command}", args: "{synthesized context}" })`

   If user selects "Deep dive":
     Offer focused follow-up team (existing behavior).

   **YOLO override:** If `[YOLO_MODE]` active, skip AskUserQuestion and directly invoke
   the recommended phase.
