# Scoring Rubric

## Behavioral Anchors

| Dimension | Pass (3) | Partial (2) | Fail (1) |
|-----------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Structure compliance | Matches macro-structure for component type exactly | Missing 1-2 optional sections | Missing required sections or wrong structure |
| Token economy | Under budget (<500 lines, <5000 tokens) with no redundant content | Under budget but contains redundant content | Over budget |
| Description quality | Has trigger phrases, activation conditions, third person, specific | Missing some trigger conditions | Vague, first person, or missing |
| Persuasion strength | Uses 3+ persuasion principles effectively | Uses 1-2 principles or uses them weakly | No persuasion techniques |
| Technique currency | Uses current best practices (XML tags, positive framing, appropriate emphasis) | Uses some current practices, has minor outdated patterns | Uses outdated patterns (emphasis overuse, anti-laziness language) |
| Prohibition clarity | All constraints are specific, unambiguous, use definitive language | Some constraints vague or use weak language ("should", "try to") | No explicit constraints or constraints are contradictory |
| Example quality | 2+ concrete, minimal, representative examples | 1 example or examples are too long/generic | No examples (when component type expects them) |
| Progressive disclosure | SKILL.md is overview, details in references/ | Some detail in SKILL.md that could move to references/ | All content crammed in one file, no progressive disclosure |
| Context engineering | Tool restrictions appropriate, minimal context passing, clean boundaries | Minor context bloat or loose tool restrictions | Unrestricted tools, excessive context, unclear boundaries |
