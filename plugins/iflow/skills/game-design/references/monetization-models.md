# Monetization Models

## Model Overview

### Premium (Pay-to-Play)
One-time purchase for full game access.
- Revenue: Single transaction at launch
- Risk indicators: Relies heavily on launch marketing; limited revenue tail
- Consider: Price sensitivity varies by platform ($5-15 mobile, $20-40 indie PC, $60-70 AAA)

### Free-to-Play (F2P)
No upfront cost; revenue from in-app purchases and/or advertising.
- Revenue: Ongoing from ~2-5% of players who convert to paying (whales drive disproportionate share)
- Risk indicators: Requires large player base; retention-dependent; ethical scrutiny on spending mechanics
- Consider: Conversion rate benchmarks, average revenue per daily active user (ARPDAU)

### Freemium
Core experience free; premium content/features behind paywall.
- Revenue: Mix of one-time unlocks and optional recurring purchases
- Risk indicators: Free experience must be compelling enough to attract, limited enough to convert
- Consider: Where the "paywall" sits — too early frustrates, too late reduces conversion

### Subscription
Recurring payment for access or premium benefits.
- Revenue: Predictable monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Risk indicators: Content treadmill — must justify ongoing cost with regular updates
- Consider: Battle pass as time-limited subscription variant (season-based commitment)

### Pay-Once-Expand
Base game purchase plus paid expansions/DLC over time.
- Revenue: Initial purchase + periodic expansion revenue spikes
- Risk indicators: Expansion fatigue if cadence is too frequent; community fragmentation if expansions split player base
- Consider: Expansion scope expectations scale with base game price point

## Risk/Viability Indicators

| Model | Revenue Predictability | Upfront Investment | Ongoing Cost | Ethical Risk |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Premium | Low (spike at launch) | Moderate | Low | Low |
| F2P | Variable (whale-dependent) | Low | High (live ops) | High |
| Freemium | Moderate | Low-Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| Subscription | High (if retained) | Moderate | High (content) | Low |
| Pay-Once-Expand | Moderate (periodic) | Moderate | Moderate | Low |

Factors to evaluate per model:
- Target audience spending habits and price sensitivity
- Required player base size for viability (F2P needs orders of magnitude more players than premium)
- Content update cadence the team can sustain
- Platform revenue share implications (30% standard, varies by store)

## Solo Indie Considerations

- Premium or pay-once-expand tend to align with solo developer capacity — ship once, update periodically
- F2P live service demands continuous content updates, community management, and analytics infrastructure that may exceed solo bandwidth
- Subscription models require sustained content cadence — evaluate whether scope is maintainable
- Consider hybrid approaches: premium base + cosmetic microtransactions (no pay-to-win)
- Platform choice affects revenue share: itch.io (0-100% developer choice), Epic Games Store (12%), Steam (20-30%), Apple/Google (15-30%)

## Anti-patterns

### Pay-to-Win
Purchasable gameplay advantages that create unfair competitive imbalance.
- Generates short-term revenue but erodes competitive player trust
- Risk: Community backlash, negative reviews, streamer/influencer criticism

### Predatory Loot Boxes
Randomized reward containers with real-money purchase and opaque odds.
- Increasing regulatory scrutiny (Belgium/Netherlands bans, EU/US legislation pending)
- Risk: Age rating implications, legal compliance costs, reputation damage

### Excessive Advertising
Frequent forced ad interruptions that degrade core experience.
- Acceptable thresholds: Opt-in rewarded ads > interstitials between sessions > forced mid-gameplay ads
- Risk: Player churn directly correlated with ad frequency and intrusiveness

### Artificial Friction (Energy Systems)
Time-gating through energy/stamina that regenerates slowly or can be purchased.
- Acceptable in some casual contexts but increasingly viewed as manipulative
- Risk: Players perceive value extraction rather than fair exchange
