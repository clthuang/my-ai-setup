# Market Structure

Frameworks for assessing crypto market size, on-chain analytics, and competitive landscape. Data sources listed here are for Stage 2 internet-researcher guidance — not for embedding static data.

## Market Sizing Dimensions

| Dimension | What It Measures | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| TVL (Total Value Locked) | Capital committed to protocol | Protocol trust, market share |
| Daily Volume | Trading activity | Liquidity, user engagement |
| Active Addresses | Unique wallets transacting | User base size |
| Transaction Count | Network usage | Adoption, congestion |
| Fee Revenue | Protocol income | Sustainability indicator |

**Key questions:** What sizing dimensions are relevant to the concept? Is there existing market to capture or does the concept create a new category?

## On-Chain Analytics Dimensions

| Metric | Signal | Assessment Use |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Holder Distribution | Concentration vs decentralization | Whale risk, governance health |
| Whale Activity | Large holder behavior | Price impact, accumulation/distribution |
| DEX vs CEX Flow | Where trading occurs | Decentralization trend, regulatory exposure |
| Staking Ratios | Percentage staked vs liquid | Network security, supply pressure |
| Gas Usage by Contract | Which contracts are most used | Product-market fit proxy |
| Token Velocity | Turnover rate | Utility vs speculation indicator |

**Key questions:** Which on-chain metrics would validate the concept? What would success look like in on-chain data?

## Data Source Guidance

These data sources guide Stage 2 internet-researcher queries. The researcher uses WebSearch to find published data — it cannot query APIs directly.

| Source | Data Type | Coverage |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| BigQuery Public Datasets | Raw blockchain data | 25+ chains (Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, etc.) |
| DeFiLlama | TVL, fees, revenue, yields | 2000+ protocols across chains |
| CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap | Price, volume, market cap | Comprehensive token coverage |
| Dune Analytics | Custom SQL queries on blockchain data | Community dashboards, protocol-specific |
| Nansen | Wallet labeling, smart money tracking | Institutional-grade analytics |
| Flipside Crypto | Community analytics, bounties | Cross-chain query platform |
| Token Terminal | Protocol financials (revenue, P/E) | Top protocols financial metrics |

**Key questions:** Which data sources are most relevant for the concept's market? What published dashboards exist?

## MarketVector Digital Asset Classification

MarketVector taxonomy (https://www.marketvector.com/indexes/digital-assets/taxonomy) provides a GICS-equivalent 3-tier classification:

**Tier 1 — Sectors:** Application, Infrastructure, Currency, Stablecoin
**Tier 2 — Industries:** Within each sector (e.g., DeFi, Smart Contract Platforms, Metaverse)
**Tier 3 — Sub-Industries:** Granular classification (e.g., DEX, Lending, Layer 2)

**Key questions:** Where does the concept fit in the MarketVector taxonomy? Which sub-industry defines the competitive set?

## Competitive Landscape Framework

When assessing competitive positioning, evaluate along these dimensions:

| Dimension | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|-----------------|
| TVL Comparison | How does TVL compare to similar protocols? What's the trend? |
| Fee Structure | How do fees compare? Is the concept more or less expensive? |
| Unique Users | How does the user base compare? Growth rate? |
| Composability | How well does the concept integrate with the ecosystem? |
| Token Incentives | Are competitors using token incentives? Are they sustainable? |
| Security Track Record | Audit history, exploit history of comparable protocols |

**Key questions:** Who are the direct competitors? What is the concept's differentiation? Is the market winner-take-all or multi-player?
