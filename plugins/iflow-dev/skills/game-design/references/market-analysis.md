# Market Analysis Frameworks

## Competitor Analysis Framework

### Direct Competitors
Games in the same genre targeting the same audience with similar core mechanics.

**Analysis dimensions:**
- Core loop comparison — how does their moment-to-moment gameplay differ?
- Monetization model — what pricing and revenue strategy do they use?
- Content cadence — how frequently do they update?
- Community size and sentiment — what do players praise/criticize?
- Platform presence — which platforms and storefronts?

### Indirect Competitors
Games competing for the same player time/attention but in different genres or formats.

**Analysis dimensions:**
- Attention overlap — what else does the target audience play?
- Session length competition — mobile games compete with social media, not just other games
- Spending competition — entertainment budget allocation across all leisure options

### Differentiation Axes
Dimensions where a new game can create distinct positioning:

| Axis | Example Differentiation |
|------|------------------------|
| Mechanic novelty | New core mechanic or genre combination |
| Art style | Distinctive visual identity in a crowded genre |
| Audience niche | Underserved demographic or interest group |
| Platform gap | Genre popular on PC but underserved on mobile |
| Price point | Premium quality at lower price, or F2P in premium-dominated genre |
| Accessibility | Lower skill floor than competitors in the same space |
| Community | Stronger social features or creator tools |

## Market Sizing

### TAM (Total Addressable Market)
Total revenue of the game's broad genre globally.
- Source from industry reports (Newzoo, Sensor Tower, Steam Spy equivalents)
- Example: Mobile puzzle games global TAM ~$8B

### SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)
Portion of TAM reachable given platform, region, and language choices.
- Filter by: target platforms, supported languages, regional availability
- Example: English-language mobile puzzle on iOS/Android in NA/EU ~$3B

### SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)
Realistic revenue capture given competition and marketing budget.
- For indie: Typically 0.01-0.1% of SAM in year one
- Factor in: marketing budget (often $0 for indie), discoverability, genre saturation
- Example: Indie mobile puzzle realistic year-one revenue $30K-$300K

### Indie-Specific Sizing Notes
- Steam median revenue for indie titles: ~$5,000-$15,000 lifetime
- Top 10% of indie games capture majority of indie revenue
- Wishlist conversion rate: ~15-20% at launch
- First-week sales typically represent 30-50% of first-year revenue

## Platform Selection Criteria

### Audience Demographics
| Platform | Primary Demographic | Session Pattern |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mobile (iOS/Android) | Broadest reach, casual-leaning, all ages | Short sessions (3-10 min), high frequency |
| PC (Steam) | Core/mid-core gamers, 18-35, willing to pay premium | Medium sessions (30-120 min) |
| Console (Switch/PS/Xbox) | Core gamers, families (Switch), 15-40 | Long sessions (30-180 min) |
| Web (itch.io/browser) | Indie enthusiasts, game jam community | Variable, discovery-driven |

### Revenue Share
| Storefront | Developer Share | Notes |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| Steam | 70-80% | 70% base, increases at $10M/$50M thresholds |
| Epic Games Store | 88% | Flat rate |
| Apple App Store | 70-85% | 85% for small business program (<$1M/year) |
| Google Play | 70-85% | 85% for first $1M/year |
| itch.io | 90-100% | Developer sets split (0-100% to platform) |
| Console stores | 70% | Standard 30% platform fee |

### Discoverability
- Steam: Algorithm-driven (tags, similar games, queue), wishlists, seasonal sales
- Mobile: App Store Optimization (ASO), featuring, paid user acquisition
- Console: Platform featuring, subscription services (Game Pass, PS Plus)
- Itch.io: Community-driven, game jam visibility, curator pages

## Community Strategy

### Platform-Specific Approaches
- **Discord:** Direct community hub — announcements, feedback, playtesting recruitment, modding support
- **Reddit:** Organic discovery via genre subreddits, devlog posts, AMA sessions
- **TikTok/YouTube Shorts:** Short-form gameplay clips for viral discovery potential
- **Twitter/X:** Developer journey updates, screenshot sharing, indie community networking
- **Steam Community:** Forums, guides, workshop (if UGC supported)

### Community as Retention Tool
- Early access / beta communities create invested advocates
- Community feedback loops improve product and build ownership
- User-generated content extends game lifetime without developer content investment
- Speedrun/challenge communities create organic marketing through content creation

### Community Sizing Expectations
- Pre-launch Discord: 100-1,000 members indicates healthy indie interest
- Steam wishlist: 10,000+ for meaningful launch visibility
- Social media: Consistency matters more than follower count for indie
