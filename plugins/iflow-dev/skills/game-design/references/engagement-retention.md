# Engagement & Retention Frameworks

## Hook Model

**Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment** (Nir Eyal)

### Trigger
What prompts the player to engage:
- **External:** Push notification, friend invite, daily reset timer, event announcement
- **Internal:** Boredom, curiosity, FOMO, desire for mastery, social belonging

### Action
The simplest behavior in anticipation of reward:
- Tap to open, start a match, check daily shop, begin a quest
- Must be easy enough that motivation exceeds friction

### Variable Reward
Unpredictable outcomes that sustain interest:
- **Tribe:** Social validation (leaderboards, likes, guild praise)
- **Hunt:** Material resources (loot drops, gacha pulls, random rewards)
- **Self:** Personal mastery (skill improvement, completion, achievement)

### Investment
User puts something in to increase future value:
- Time (leveling characters), data (saved progress), social capital (guild membership), money (purchased items)
- Investment increases switching cost and primes the next trigger

## Progression Mechanics

### XP Curves
- **Linear:** Constant XP per level (simple, predictable)
- **Exponential:** Increasing XP per level (natural difficulty scaling, slows late-game)
- **S-Curve:** Fast early levels, slow mid, fast late (fast onboarding, hard middle, rewarding endgame)

### Unlock Gates
- **Level gates:** Reach level N to access content
- **Currency gates:** Accumulate resource to purchase access
- **Skill gates:** Demonstrate mastery to proceed (boss fights, challenges)
- **Social gates:** Require group cooperation (raids, team missions)

### Mastery Indicators
Visible signals of player skill and dedication:
- Star ratings, completion percentages, titles, cosmetic rewards
- Should feel aspirational to new players and validating to veterans

## Social Features

### Leaderboards
- Global, friends-only, and relative (show nearby ranks)
- Reset periodically to prevent stagnation
- Risk: Demotivating for bottom-tier players — consider segmented boards

### Guilds/Clans
- Shared objectives, exclusive content, communication channels
- Guild progression (guild XP, group unlocks) adds retention layer
- Social obligation increases return rate

### Cooperative Play
- Shared goals with complementary roles
- Difficulty scaled to group size
- Matchmaking quality directly impacts retention

### Community Integration
- In-game sharing (screenshots, replays, builds)
- UGC tools (level editors, mod support)
- Community events that bridge in-game and external platforms

## Daily Engagement Patterns

### Daily Quests/Missions
- Refresh every 24 hours, 3-5 tasks of varying difficulty
- Reward bonus for completing all daily tasks
- Should take 10-30 minutes to complete full set

### Login Rewards
- Escalating rewards over consecutive days (day 1: common, day 7: rare, day 30: epic)
- Consider "catch-up" mechanics to reduce frustration from missed days
- Risk: Players log in but don't play — pair with engagement tasks

### Event Cycles
- **Weekly:** Rotating challenge modes, featured content
- **Monthly:** Themed events, special rewards
- **Seasonal:** Major content updates, battle passes, narrative arcs
- Time-limited rewards create urgency and FOMO

## Retention Frameworks

### Key Benchmarks
| Metric | Casual | Mid-Core | Core |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| D1 (Day 1) | 35-45% | 30-40% | 25-35% |
| D7 (Day 7) | 15-20% | 12-18% | 10-15% |
| D30 (Day 30) | 5-8% | 4-7% | 3-6% |

### Churn Indicators
- Session length declining over time
- Decreasing purchase frequency
- Reduced social interaction (fewer messages, guild inactivity)
- Skipping daily engagement patterns
- Increased time between sessions

### Retention Strategies by Phase
- **Day 1-3:** Onboarding quality — tutorial clarity, first-session hook, early reward
- **Day 4-7:** Core loop engagement — depth discovery, social connection, first meaningful choice
- **Day 8-30:** Meta loop binding — progression investment, community membership, sunk cost
- **Day 30+:** Content freshness — seasonal updates, endgame variety, community events
