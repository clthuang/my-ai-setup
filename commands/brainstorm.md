Invoke the brainstorming skill.

Check docs/features/ for active feature:
- If found: Ask whether to add to existing feature or start new brainstorm
- If not found: Start standalone brainstorm (creates scratch file in docs/brainstorms/)

Follow brainstorming skill instructions for exploration and optional promotion to feature.
