# iflow Plugin

> A Claude Code plugin that turns ideas into shipped features through structured phases — brainstorm, spec, design, plan, implement — with built-in quality gates, semantic memory, and autonomous operation.

## What It Does

iflow guides features from idea to merge through proven phases. Every phase has AI reviewers that catch issues before they compound. The plugin learns from retrospectives — memory persists across sessions and projects. It can run fully autonomously (YOLO mode) or step-by-step with user confirmation at each gate. Domain knowledge modules cover game design, crypto/DeFi, and data science.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Claude Code | latest | The CLI tool from Anthropic |
| Python | 3.10+ | Required for semantic memory. Linux: also install `python3-venv` |
| git | any | Required |

Optional: `rsync` and `gtimeout` (macOS: `brew install coreutils`).

### Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add clthuang/my-ai-setup
/plugin install iflow@my-local-plugins
```

Core dependencies auto-install on first session — keyword memory works immediately.

### Setup semantic memory (recommended)

The plugin auto-installs core dependencies on first launch. For semantic search (vs keyword-only), configure an embedding provider:

```bash
# Find your plugin root and run the interactive setup
bash "$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow/*/scripts/setup.sh 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
```

The setup walks through provider selection, API key configuration, and project initialization.

| Provider | API Key | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| gemini | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Free tier available (default) |
| openai | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | text-embedding-3-small |
| voyage | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | voyage-3-lite |
| ollama | — | Local; `ollama pull nomic-embed-text` |
| none | — | Keyword-only search |

### Troubleshooting

```bash
bash "$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/iflow/*/scripts/doctor.sh 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
```

Read-only health check across 5 categories (system prerequisites, plugin environment, embedding provider, memory system, project context) with OS-specific fix commands.

## Quick Start

**Just describe what you need:**
```bash
/iflow:secretary "add email validation to the signup form"
```
Secretary routes your request to the right workflow phase or specialist automatically.

**Or start directly:**
```bash
/iflow:brainstorm "your idea here"       # Explore an idea
/iflow:create-feature "add user auth"    # Build something
```

Then follow the phases:
```
/iflow:specify → /iflow:design → /iflow:create-plan → /iflow:create-tasks → /iflow:implement → /iflow:finish-feature
```

## Key Features

### Autonomous Operation (YOLO Mode)

```bash
/iflow:secretary mode yolo              # Enable autonomous mode
/iflow:secretary orchestrate <desc>     # Build end-to-end without pausing
/iflow:secretary continue               # Resume from last completed phase
```

All quality gates (reviewers, phase validators) still run — YOLO mode only bypasses user confirmation at phase transitions. Safety boundaries stop execution on review failures, merge conflicts, or missing prerequisites.

**Modes:** `manual` (default) | `aware` (session hints) | `yolo` (fully autonomous)

### Semantic Memory

Two MCP tools persist learnings across sessions:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `store_memory` | Save a pattern, anti-pattern, or heuristic to long-term memory |
| `search_memory` | Search past learnings by topic using semantic similarity |

Memory entries are injected automatically at session start. The global store (`~/.claude/iflow/memory/`) accumulates knowledge across all projects. See [README_FOR_DEV.md](./README_FOR_DEV.md) for configuration.

### Domain Knowledge

Built-in specialist knowledge for brainstorming and code review:
- **Game design** — core loop analysis, engagement strategy, aesthetic direction, feasibility
- **Crypto/DeFi** — protocol comparison, tokenomics, market strategy, risk assessment
- **Data science** — methodology assessment, pitfall analysis, modeling approach, DS code review

### Specialist Teams

`/iflow:create-specialist-team` assembles ephemeral multi-perspective teams for complex tasks that need diverse expertise.

### Review System

Every phase has a skeptic reviewer that challenges assumptions and a gatekeeper that validates completeness. Quality gates prevent issues from compounding across phases.

## For Developers

See [README_FOR_DEV.md](./README_FOR_DEV.md) for:
- Component authoring (skills, agents, hooks)
- Architecture and design principles
- Release workflow
- Validation

Each project uses `.claude/iflow.local.md` for local settings (artifacts path, merge branch, memory config). See [README_FOR_DEV.md](./README_FOR_DEV.md) for the full configuration reference.
