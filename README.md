# pd Plugin

> A Claude Code plugin that turns ideas into shipped features through structured phases — brainstorm, spec, design, plan, implement — with built-in quality gates and autonomous operation.

## What It Does

pd guides features from idea to merge through proven phases. Every phase boundary has a mechanical gate, and two LLM review moments (design review, adversarial code review) catch issues before they compound. Retrospectives capture learnings as plain-markdown retros at feature completion. It can run fully autonomously (YOLO mode) or step-by-step with user confirmation at each gate. Small changes take an express lane that skips straight to implement. Domain knowledge modules cover game design, crypto/DeFi, and data science.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| Claude Code | latest | The CLI tool from Anthropic |
| Python | 3.10+ | Required for MCP servers. Linux: also install `python3-venv` |
| git | any | Required |

Optional: `rsync` and `gtimeout` (macOS: `brew install coreutils`).

### Install

```bash
/plugin marketplace add clthuang/pedantic-drip
/plugin install pd@pedantic-drip-marketplace
```

Core dependencies auto-install on first session.

### Troubleshooting

```bash
bash "$(ls -d ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/pd/*/scripts/doctor.sh 2>/dev/null | head -1)"
```

Read-only health check across system prerequisites, plugin environment, and project context with OS-specific fix commands (12 environment checks). For workspace data-consistency diagnostics, run `/pd:doctor` inside a session instead — it runs 10 checks including security-review command presence, stale worktree detection, status write-path enforcement, free-text status-parser regression detection, and severity vocabulary validation.

## Quick Start

**Just describe what you need:**
```bash
/pd:secretary "add email validation to the signup form"
```
Secretary routes your request to the right workflow phase or specialist automatically.

**Or start directly:**
```bash
/pd:brainstorm "your idea here"       # Explore an idea
/pd:create-feature "add user auth"    # Build something
```

Then follow the phases:
```
/pd:specify → /pd:design → /pd:create-plan → /pd:implement → /pd:finish-feature
```

## Key Features

### Autonomous Operation (YOLO Mode)

```bash
/pd:secretary mode yolo              # Enable autonomous mode
/pd:secretary orchestrate <desc>     # Build end-to-end without pausing
/pd:secretary continue               # Resume from last completed phase
```

All quality gates (mechanical phase gates, review moments, QA execution) still run — YOLO mode only bypasses user confirmation at phase transitions. Safety boundaries stop execution on engine transition rejections, merge conflicts, or a review gate still failing after its one fix round.

**Modes:** `manual` (default) | `aware` (session hints) | `yolo` (fully autonomous)

### Domain Knowledge

Built-in specialist knowledge for brainstorming and code review:
- **Game design** — core loop analysis, engagement strategy, aesthetic direction, feasibility
- **Crypto/DeFi** — protocol comparison, tokenomics, market strategy, risk assessment
- **Data science** — methodology assessment, pitfall analysis, modeling approach, DS code review

### Kanban Board (UI Server)

The plugin auto-starts a local Kanban board at `http://localhost:8718/` on every session start. The board shows features, brainstorms, backlog items, and projects with their workflow phases and lineage in real time, scoped to the current project's workspace by default. A header dropdown switches the view to any other populated workspace or to all workspaces at once (selection persists via cookie). No manual setup required.

Configure via `.claude/pd.local.md`:
- `ui_server_enabled: false` — disable auto-start
- `ui_server_port: 8718` — change the port

### Specialist Teams

`/pd:create-specialist-team` assembles ephemeral multi-perspective teams for complex tasks that need diverse expertise.

## Commands

### Core Workflow

| `/pd:implement` | Write code with TDD, execution QA, and code review |
| `/pd:abandon-feature` | Transition a feature to abandoned status |
| `/pd:finish-feature` | QA battery, docs sync, retro, merge (pd features) |
| `/pd:wrap-up` | End the session — commit WIP, report engine state and open items |

### Quality Gates

Every phase boundary runs a mechanical gate (`scripts/phase-gate.sh`) that checks artifacts, required sections, and duplicate contract blocks — no agent dispatch, no judgement. On top of that sit exactly two LLM review moments per deep feature: `design-reviewer` after the design phase gate, and `code-quality-reviewer` on the branch diff during implement. Each is one pass plus at most one fix round; anything still open escalates to you. `qa-executor` runs the suites and drives affected flows during implement, and `security-reviewer` runs at finish when the branch touches a security surface.

```

### Task Format

Tasks live in `plan.md` under `## Plan` and are derived into dispatches at implement time. Each task names:

- What it changes and which files it touches
- The command that proves it done (test invocation, script, or grep)
- Whether it is parallel-safe — non-intersecting file sets run as `implementer` agents in `.pd-worktrees/task-{N}` isolation and merge back in plan order

## Reference

pd includes 27 skills and 24 agents that run automatically during the workflow. You don't invoke them directly.

## For Developers

See [README_FOR_DEV.md](./README_FOR_DEV.md) for:
- Component authoring (skills, agents, hooks)
- Architecture and design principles
- Release workflow
- Validation

Each project uses `.claude/pd.local.md` for local settings (artifacts path, merge branch). See [README_FOR_DEV.md](./README_FOR_DEV.md) for the full configuration reference.
