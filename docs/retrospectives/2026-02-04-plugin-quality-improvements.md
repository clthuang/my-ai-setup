# Retrospective: iflow-dev Plugin Quality Improvements

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Source:** Learnings from [Anthropic's official plugin-dev repository](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/plugin-dev)

## Summary

Applied quality improvements to the iflow-dev plugin based on patterns from Anthropic's official plugin-dev guidance. Updated 17 skills, 20 agents, 2 commands, and README documentation.

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel execution** - Subagents researched official patterns and reviewed changes simultaneously
2. **Systematic application** - Applied changes to all 17 skills and 20 agents in batch operations
3. **Color semantics** - Created a logical color scheme for agents by functional category
4. **Zero validation errors** - All changes passed ./validate.sh with no errors

## What We Learned

### Official Plugin-dev Patterns

| Component | Official Pattern | What We Applied |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Skills** | `This skill should be used when the user asks to "phrase"...` | Third-person format with 4 trigger phrases |
| **Agents** | `Use this agent when the user asks to "phrase"...` | Numbered triggers: (1) context (2-4) user phrases |
| **Colors** | Semantic by function (magenta=creative, yellow=validation) | Category-based: cyan=research, green=impl, etc. |
| **Commands** | Brief, under 100 chars | Shortened to under 60 chars |

### Key Insights

1. **Trigger phrases are critical** - Both skills and agents use explicit quoted phrases like "user says 'X'" to enable intent matching. This is the primary mechanism for AI to select the right component.

2. **Progressive disclosure** - Official plugins put lean content in SKILL.md (<3,000 words) with detailed content in `references/` subdirectories.

3. **Third-person language** - Descriptions use "This skill should be used when..." not second-person "Use this skill when you..."

4. **Color semantics matter** - Colors provide visual distinction in terminal output. Our scheme:
   - `cyan` = Research agents (exploration, investigation)
   - `green` = Implementation agents (writing code/docs)
   - `blue` = Planning/validation agents (chain, design, plan review)
   - `yellow` = Early-stage review (brainstorm, PRD)
   - `magenta` = Quality/compliance review (spec, security, final)
   - `red` = Simplification (code-simplifier)

5. **Model inheritance** - Official agents prefer `model: inherit` over hardcoding `opus` or `sonnet`

### Pattern Differences

Our implementation differs slightly from official patterns:

| Aspect | Official | Our Implementation | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Agent triggers | Prose format | Numbered (1)(2)(3)(4) | More scannable, same info |
| Skill triggers | Quoted phrases | Single quotes in prose | Functionally equivalent |
| Command length | <100 chars | <60 chars | More conservative |

## Action Items

### Immediate
- [x] Apply patterns to all skills and agents
- [x] Add color field to all agents
- [x] Fix command descriptions
- [x] Update README component counts

### Future Considerations
1. **Update validation script** - Current script warns about missing "Use when..." but we now use "Triggers:" format
2. **Document color scheme** - Add to Component Authoring Guide so future agents follow convention
3. **Consider skill colors** - Skills don't have colors yet; could add for visual grouping
4. **Version field** - Official skills include `version: 0.1.0`; consider adding

## Open Questions

1. Should we standardize on exactly 4 trigger phrases, or allow flexibility?
2. Should the numbered trigger format be documented as our local convention?
3. When does a skill need `references/` subdirectory vs inline content?

## Files Changed

| Type | Count | Pattern Applied |
|------|-------|-----------------|
| Skills | 17 | Third-person descriptions with trigger phrases |
| Agents | 20 | Descriptions with numbered triggers + colors |
| Commands | 2 | Shortened descriptions |
| README | 1 | Fixed agent count (15→20), updated agent table |

## Validation

```
./validate.sh
Errors: 0
Warnings: 52 (expected - script checks for old "Use when..." pattern)
```
