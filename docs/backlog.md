# Backlog

| ID | Timestamp | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| 00008 | 2026-01-31T12:05:00Z | add product manager, product owner team (agents, skills) |
| 00012 | 2026-02-17T12:00:00Z | fix the secretary AskUserQuestion formatting. The user should be able to select the options directly and also continue to chat if desired. |
| 00014 | 2026-02-24T12:01:00Z | Security Scanning — static rule-based security scanning alongside the agent-based security-reviewer (inspired by ECC's AgentShield with 102 rules). See ecc-comparison-improvements.md Item 10. |
| 00015 | 2026-02-24T12:02:00Z | Cross-Platform Hooks — port Bash hooks to Node.js for Windows compatibility. See ecc-comparison-improvements.md Item 11. |
| 00016 | 2026-02-24T12:03:00Z | Multi-Model Orchestration — route to multiple AI providers (Codex, Gemini) alongside Claude for cost optimization or specialized tasks. See ecc-comparison-improvements.md Item 12. |
| 00017 | 2026-02-27T12:00:00Z | Unified Central Context Management — expand the knowledge bank DB into a unified central context management service. All agents retrieve required context from the DB. The main orchestration agent sends background context as DB indices to subagents rather than full text. |
| 00018 | 2026-02-27T12:01:00Z | Knowledge Bank Auto-Logging — upgrade knowledge bank to automatically and asynchronously log all session conversations via subagents. Capture every prompt and response, index after each turn. Rethink DB schema to include enriched metadata: session_id, raw prompt/response, categories, timestamps, and other appropriate fields. |
| 00020 | 2026-02-27T13:53:55Z | Consider renaming the plugin/repository to `pedantic-drips` for the public MIT open-source release to highlight the adversarial reviewing nature of the workflow. |
| 00021 | 2026-02-27T15:42:49Z | Token Efficiency Improvements: Refactor the multi-agent context passing to reduce O(N) token growth per phase. Specifically, investigate (1) Prompt Caching for static upstream artifacts like PRD/Spec, (2) Pruning prompt context per reviewer rubric, and (3) Reusing the same agent instance (threading) during review loops to handle diffs rather than full file structures. See `token_efficiency_analysis.md` for full breakdown. (promoted → feature:030-token-efficiency-improvements) |
| 00022 | 2026-02-27T09:34:32Z | Comprehensive Prompt Refactoring: Update commands, agent rubrics, and descriptions to strictly adhere to Anthropic best practices. This includes removing subjective adjectives (appropriate, sufficient, robust), resolving mixed 'Phase vs Chain' validation terminology, and enforcing imperative mood across command descriptions. See `comprehensive_feedback_report.md` for exact refactoring proposals and code blocks. |
| 00023 | 2026-02-27T18:36:43+08:00 | Redesign of `promptimize` Skill: Refactor the `promptimize` skill to comply with Anthropic best practices. The skill currently suffers from the 'God Prompt' anti-pattern, uses brittle HTML comment injection instead of XML, performs deterministic float math in the LLM, and uses unreliable text-merging algorithms. See `promptimize_feedback.md` for detailed critique. |
| 00024 | 2026-02-27T22:26:00+08:00 | Add `remove_entry` method to the entity registry and ensure each entity has a status attribute. Currently there is no delete/remove API on `EntityDatabase`, and the `status` field is optional with no default — consider enforcing a default status on registration. |
| 00025 | 2026-02-27T22:30:00+08:00 | Unified Context Management System — converge entity registry and knowledge bank into a single knowledge graph with RAG optimized for coding agents. Key changes: add edges/relationships table bridging entities and memory entries, replace fixed entity types with flexible node types, implement on-demand retrieval during agent work (not just session start), add relevance feedback loop, implement keyword generation (currently dead code), deprecate legacy memory.py. 5-phase roadmap in detail. See [`entity-and-memory-system-review.md`](entity-and-memory-system-review.md) for full critical review and expansion roadmap. |
| 00026 | 2026-02-27T22:51:54+0800 | Add feature subfiles into the entity DB to facilitate referencing entry IDs for future lazy-loading designs. |
