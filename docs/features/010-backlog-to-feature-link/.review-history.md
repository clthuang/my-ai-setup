# Review History: Feature 010

## Phase: specify

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-31T12:55:00Z

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] The 5 acceptance criteria scenarios are only listed by name without specifying the actual criteria for each.
- [blocker] The exact format of the brainstorm header pattern is not specified.
- [warning] The 'Not Found' scenario mentions 'with warning' but does not define what type of warning.

**Changes Made:**
- Added Technical Details section with explicit regex pattern `\*Source: Backlog #(\d{5})\*`
- Updated acceptance criteria to include the regex pattern reference
- Clarified warning format for "Not Found" scenario: `⚠️ Backlog item #XXXXX not found in docs/backlog.md`
- Added that backlog_source is still stored even when backlog item not found (for traceability)

### Iteration 2 - 2026-01-31T13:05:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Spec references '/create-feature' but actual command path is '/iflow:create-feature'
- [warning] Backlog table format dependency is stated but exact column positions not documented
- [note] Spec could reference that /iflow:create-feature already creates .meta.json

**Changes Made:**
None required - warnings noted for design phase consideration.

## Phase: design

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-31T13:15:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Algorithm shows row removal with blank line cleanup but doesn't specify exact mechanism for atomic file writes in command context
- [note] Design correctly identifies insertion point in create-feature.md (after Create Metadata File, before State Tracking)
- [note] Backlog.md format in design matches actual file format - row pattern will work correctly

**Changes Made:**
None required - design approved on first iteration.

---

## Phase: create-plan

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-31T13:25:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 2 describes updating meta JSON template but shows brainstorm_source in template example - could confuse task creators
- [note] Line ~71 insertion point is accurate per actual file structure
- [note] Plan does not explicitly mention blank line handling after row removal

**Changes Made:**
None required - plan approved on first iteration. Step 2 clarification noted for task creation.

---

## Phase: create-tasks

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-31T13:35:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 1 specifies inserting before "State Tracking" but does not provide exact line number from plan (~71)
- [note] Task 2 could show complete updated template for clarity

**Changes Made:**
None required - tasks approved on first iteration.

---

## Phase: implement

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-31T13:45:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Reviewers:**
- Chain-reviewer: Approved - all three tasks correctly implemented
- Final-reviewer (spec compliance): Approved - all requirements from spec implemented

**Issues:**
- [note] No automated tests, but appropriate for markdown command documentation
- [note] Edge case for "not found" could explicitly state backlog_source is still stored

**Changes Made:**
- Added "Handle Backlog Source" section at lines 76-90 with correct regex pattern
- Updated meta template to include brainstorm_source field
- Updated Output section with conditional backlog linkage message

**Files Changed:**
- plugins/iflow/commands/create-feature.md
