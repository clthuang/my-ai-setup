## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-10T12:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [clarity] Scale signals referenced but not enumerated in spec (at: FR-1, Success Criteria line 1)
- [blocker] [clarity] Decomposition output schema referenced but not defined (at: FR-3, AC-4)
- [blocker] [clarity] Project .meta.json schema not defined (at: FR-2, AC-3)
- [blocker] [assumptions] Feature creation mechanism from decomposition ambiguous (at: FR-4, AC-7)
- [blocker] [assumptions] Planned→active transition entirely unspecified (at: Scope, AC section)
- [warning] [traceability] Phase 1 single-active constraint not acknowledged (at: Out of Scope)
- [warning] [traceability] depends_on_features enforcement deferral not stated (at: FR-4)
- [warning] [traceability] AC-15 vs Out of Scope contradiction on show-status (at: AC-15, Out of Scope line 3)
- [warning] [testability] Milestone grouping range vague (at: AC-6)
- [warning] [assumptions] validate.sh planned feature compatibility (at: Success Criteria line 10)
- [warning] [assumptions] Context injection mechanism unclear (at: FR-4b)
- [warning] [assumptions] expected_lifetime setter unspecified (at: FR-5, AC-3)
- [warning] [testability] AC-12/13 test LLM judgment (at: AC-12, AC-13)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Component count "11" unclear (at: FR-6, Success Criteria line 15)
- [suggestion] [clarity] AC-8/9 "available as context" not verifiable (at: AC-8, AC-9)
- [suggestion] [clarity] /create-project command interface unspecified (at: FR-2)

**Changes Made:**
- Enumerated all 6 scale signals with detection heuristics in FR-1
- Added full decomposition output JSON schema in FR-3
- Added full project .meta.json schema in FR-2 with expected_lifetime
- Specified decomposing skill creates feature directories directly (FR-4)
- Added complete planned→active transition flow (5 steps) with AC-8
- Added single-active-feature enforcement for Phase 1 in FR-4
- Added explicit deferral note for depends_on_features enforcement
- Clarified Out of Scope: "Full project dashboard" vs basic grouping in Phase 1
- Delegated milestone grouping to LLM decomposer via suggested_milestones
- Added validate.sh planned feature compatibility with AC-18
- Specified context injection as Step 5 in validateAndSetup with exact markdown format
- Specified expected_lifetime set during project creation via AskUserQuestion
- Reframed AC-12/13 to test system-level behavior (prompt criteria, JSON fields)
- Clarified component count as "6 direct + 5 phase commands via workflow-transitions"
- Reframed AC-8/9 as verifiable assertions (presence of headings in input context)
- Specified /create-project as both auto-invoked and standalone with --prd argument

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-10T12:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (all 5 blockers resolved)

## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-10T12:35:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] FR-5/FR-6 numbering collides with PRD Phase 2 FR numbers — noted for traceability
- [warning] expected_lifetime is a spec-level addition to PRD schema — noted for traceability
- [warning] No AC for list-features with planned features — designer can infer from FR-6
- [suggestion] Decomposition output feature names → id-slug mapping not explicitly called out
- [suggestion] Project .meta.json schema example shows post-decomposition state vs AC-3 creation state
