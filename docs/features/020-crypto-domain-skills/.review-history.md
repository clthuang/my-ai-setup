# Review History: 020-crypto-domain-skills

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-08T05:40:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [feasibility] NFR-3 vs C2.1-C2.5: Brainstorming SKILL.md at 484/500 lines — adding second domain's hardcoded content exceeds budget. Spec doesn't address arithmetic conflict.
  Suggestion: Refactor to generic domain-dispatch pattern, raise limit, or extract PRD template.
- [blocker] [clarity] C2.2 Step 10 dispatch mechanism unspecified — currently hardcoded to game-design. Must specify conditional vs generic vs lookup table approach.
  Suggestion: Make Step 10 domain-generic with mapping from Step 9 selection.
- [warning] [assumptions] No loop-back behavior specified for crypto domain — current check only handles ## Game Design Analysis.
  Suggestion: Add loop-back for ## Crypto Analysis or make it generic.
- [warning] [testability] FR-9 crypto research prompts lack specificity — need actual prompt lines like game-design has.
  Suggestion: Specify 3 concrete prompt lines for internet-researcher dispatch.
- [warning] [traceability] C3 reviewer mechanism ambiguous — hardcoded second table vs dynamic parse.
  Suggestion: Pick one mechanism and document it.
- [warning] [testability] FR acceptance criteria need Given/When/Then format for measurable verification.
  Suggestion: Add concrete acceptance tests per FR.
- [warning] [assumptions] CCAF and MarketVector references undefined.
  Suggestion: Add citations or clarify as reference examples.
- [suggestion] [clarity] Add disclaimer line to Crypto Analysis header for financial advice boundary.
- [suggestion] [clarity] Add BS-8 clarifying all reference files loaded unconditionally (no sub-domain selection).

**Changes Made:**
Addressed all blockers and warnings: refactored C2 to generic domain-dispatch pattern (solved line budget), specified Step 10 dispatch mechanism, made loop-back generic, added 5 concrete crypto research prompt lines, clarified C3 as static table keyed by domain, added Given/When/Then for C2.3, added CCAF/MarketVector URLs, added BS-8 (unconditional loading), added BS-9 (disclaimer).

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-08T05:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (non-blocking):**
- [warning] "Base directory" term undefined in C2.2
- [warning] PRD-to-spec scope deviation undocumented (generic dispatch was PRD's Out of Scope)
- [warning] Line budget math uses approximate values
- [warning] Acceptance criteria inconsistent (C2.3 uses Given/When/Then, others don't)
- [warning] Two-phase write buffer not explicitly cleared in loop-back
- [suggestion] Remove "target" line counts from C4 (keep only max)
- [suggestion] Add sentence to C2.5 about source of truth shifting to domain SKILL.md

**Changes Made:**
None required — all warnings are non-blocking and approved for design phase.

## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-08T06:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (non-blocking):**
- [warning] C2.1 registry format not explicitly stated as static inline mapping
- [warning] Game-design SKILL.md Stage 2 Research Context migration content not specified
- [warning] Line budget analysis not provided as explicit net delta calculation
- [warning] C2.5 two-line generic placeholder text not shown
- [suggestion] C4.7 review-criteria.md should state "follows same structure as game-design/references/review-criteria.md"
- [suggestion] BS-9 disclaimer relationship to "Does NOT" list could be clearer

**Changes Made:**
None required — phase-reviewer confirmed spec is ready for design. Warnings are quality concerns the designer can resolve by referencing existing game-design patterns.
