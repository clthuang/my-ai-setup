## Design Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-27T19:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] PRD section-scoping loss for test-deepener (full file vs Problem Statement + Goals)
- [warning] [completeness] I8 step 3a is dead code (brainstorm features always copy prd.md)
- [warning] [completeness] I1 Implementation Files section should be conditional for phase commands
- [warning] [feasibility] Grep audit false positives from non-artifact content injection patterns

**Changes Made:**
- Added inline comment in I4 for test-deepener full PRD read justification
- Added defensive-fallback comment to I8 step 3a
- Made I1 Implementation Files section conditional (implement.md dispatches only)
- Added Verification Note for grep audit false positives

---

## Design Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-27T19:40:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] code-simplifier losing spec.md for YAGNI — spec-level decision, not design flaw
- [warning] [completeness] I9 fallback detection is observational-only with no corrective action
- [warning] [consistency] Artifact-under-review convention implicit in I5
- [warning] [completeness] prd.md section-scoping loss in I7 for implementer dispatches

**Changes Made:**
- Added NFR2 escalation comment in I4 code-simplifier entry
- Expanded I9 description with multi-reviewer redundancy rationale
- Added explicit artifact-under-review note above I5
- Added note in I7 about intentional full-PRD simplification

---

## Design Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-27T20:00:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] I5 review-target vs upstream-context distinction needs implementer guidance
- [warning] [completeness] NFR2 fallback_count persistence across features unspecified
- [warning] [consistency] R3 pruning is behavioral change, not just transport — constraint imprecision

**Changes Made:**
- Added explicit implementer instruction to I5 note
- Added cross-feature accumulation grep command to I9
- Added TD5b documenting R3 as intentional behavioral adjustment

---

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-27T20:35:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] File Change Summary I9 scope ambiguous — not all files listed I9 explicitly
- [warning] No PRD sentinel example missing from I8

**Changes Made:**
- Added I9 fallback detection to all 6 file rows in File Change Summary
- Added concrete PRD sentinel example to I8
- Clarified I9 execution order (before JSON parsing)

---

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-27T20:45:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] I9 fallback_count wording implies separate variable but none defined

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced "Increment fallback_count" with "LAZY-LOAD-WARNING entry constitutes the NFR2 tracking record"
- Added implementation order suggestion to File Change Summary

---

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-27T20:55:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 7e implement.md dispatch not clearly mapped to I1/I4
- [warning] Phase 2 planning boundary unclear — planner may create tasks for I2/I3/I6

**Changes Made:**
- Added parenthetical clarifying step 7e uses I1 with "implementer" key from I4
- Added explicit Phase 2 planning exclusion statement
- Added specific retained extractSection patterns to Verification Note

---

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-27T21:05:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**

---

## Design Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-27T20:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings (iteration cap reached)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] TD5b should document test-deepener PRD expansion alongside code-simplifier
- [warning] [completeness] I9 fallback detection scope ambiguous across commands
- [warning] [consistency] N-reads tradeoff for spec/prd in per-task implementer dispatches not acknowledged

**Changes Made:**

- Added I9 scope clarification: applies to all 6 in-scope files
- Added N-reads tradeoff note to TD4
- Added implementing skill's retained extractSection to Verification Note

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-27T21:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** plan-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumption] Steps 1F.4/1F.5 do not clearly acknowledge R3 pruning behavioral changes (removing 3 artifacts from code-quality/security reviewers)
- [blocker] [failure-mode] No "Why this item" / "Why this order" rationale on any step
- [warning] [assumption] Review-target transport mechanism unclear — "keep inline" not defined
- [warning] [failure-mode] I9 fallback detection on non-reviewer action agents may produce frequent warnings
- [warning] [dependency] Test-deepener Phase B exclusion from conversion not explicitly stated
- [warning] [failure-mode] Grep audit false positive list inaccurate after SKILL.md conversion
- [warning] [tdd-order] No manual end-to-end validation step in plan
- [warning] [assumption] Premature removal of "always a NEW Task" directive loses documentation

**Changes Made:**
- Added Conventions section: review-target transport, R3 pruning acknowledgment, I9 for action agents, "always a NEW Task" replacement, batch note
- Added "Why this item" / "Why this order" rationale to every phase
- Added explicit "R3 pruning change" labels to Steps 1F.1, 1F.2, 1F.4, 1F.5
- Clarified review-target stays orchestrator-injected inline (not lazy-loaded)
- Added Phase B exclusion note to Step 1F.2
- Refined grep audit false positive list (only brainstorming/SKILL.md and retrospecting/SKILL.md)
- Added Step 1G.3: Manual end-to-end validation
- Replaced "Remove 'always a NEW Task'" with replacement directive text

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-27T21:30:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** plan-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumption] PRD pattern variance between implement.md and phase commands not acknowledged
- [warning] [assumption] Step 1G.2 agent frontmatter check success criteria imprecise
- [warning] [failure-mode] I9 insertion point within control flow not specified

**Changes Made:**
- Added "PRD conditional pattern variance" convention explaining both patterns map to I8
- Added "I9 insertion point" convention: after response, before JSON parsing
- Refined Step 1G.2 to list all 11 specific agents from I4/I5
- Changed grep -rP to grep -rE for macOS compatibility
- Clarified batch note: numbering is readability, not dependency

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-27T21:40:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** plan-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumption] brainstorming/SKILL.md incorrectly listed as grep false positive (won't match pattern)
- [warning] [assumption] Grep audit misses section-scoped PRD injection patterns

**Changes Made:**
- Removed brainstorming/SKILL.md from false positive list; kept only retrospecting/SKILL.md
- Added secondary grep pattern for section-scoped PRD patterns

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-27T21:50:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** plan-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumption] "Always a NEW Task" is parenthetical in prose, not standalone — replacement needs to preserve surrounding text
- [warning] [assumption] implement.md has no "always a NEW Task" directive — convention should not imply it applies there
- [warning] [failure-mode] Secondary grep should expect zero matches from both implement.md and SKILL.md after conversion
- [warning] [assumption] Primary grep coverage gap for section-scoped PRD — already covered by secondary grep

**Changes Made:**
- Clarified "Always a NEW Task" convention: parenthetical in 4 phase commands only, not implement.md
- Added expected zero matches note to secondary grep verification
- No change for primary grep gap (secondary grep already covers it, reviewer acknowledged)

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-27T21:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Plan steps not fully visible in prompt — reviewer received compressed summary instead of full plan.md content
- [blocker] Design interfaces (I1, I4, I5, I7, I8, I9) referenced by label only — reviewer could not see definitions
- [warning] R3 pruning counts don't name specific artifacts removed per step
- [warning] 1G verification doesn't specify grep patterns, agent list, or e2e criteria

**Changes Made:**
- All issues were caused by prompt compression in the previous session, not actual plan.md deficiencies. The full plan.md (252 lines) contains all 16 steps with file paths, actions, traceability, R3 pruning details with specific artifact names, and 1G verification with exact grep patterns and all 11 agent names.
- Re-dispatching with complete plan.md content.

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-27T22:00:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] Steps 1F.1-1F.6 prose says "not technically dependent" but they target the same file — contradiction with dependency chain
- [warning] "No I8 needed" notes in 1F.1, 1F.4, 1F.5 are ambiguous about whether I8 is a missing step or intentional omission
- [suggestion] 1A gate is soft — task-executor could bypass de-risking by starting 1B-1E before 1A confirmed

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced "not technically dependent" prose with "must be executed sequentially (same file)"
- Replaced "No I8 needed (no PRD in mapping)" with explicit clarification in all 3 steps (1F.1, 1F.4, 1F.5)

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-27T22:10:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 1G.1 grep audit lists only 1 expected false positive but design Verification Note lists 3 (retrospecting, brainstorming, implementing extractSection)
- [warning] "Always a NEW Task" directive replacement defined in Conventions but step bullets say vague "Phase 1/2 directive comment" instead of exact replacement text

**Changes Made:**
- Expanded Step 1G.1 to list all 3 expected remaining matches with rationale
- Replaced vague "Phase 1/2 directive comment" in all step bullets with exact replacement text from Convention

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-27T22:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved with warnings

**Issues:**
- [warning] "Add I9" instruction lacks reference to where the exact I9 template text lives in the design
- [warning] Step 1G.2 agent frontmatter check doesn't state its purpose or pass/fail criteria
- [suggestion] 1F sequential constraint could note these are a single editing pass, not separate saves

**Changes Made:**
- Added "See Design I9 (`check_artifact_confirmation` function) for the verbatim check to insert" to I9 Convention
- Added Purpose and Pass/fail lines to Step 1G.2

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-27T22:30:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (iteration cap reached)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Overview says "16 steps" but actual count is 18 (1+8+6+3)
- [suggestion] Step 1A.1 lacks explicit done-when signal
- [suggestion] Step 1F.2 Phase B exclusion could say "leave unchanged"

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed step count in overview (16→18, 13→15 conversion steps)
- Suggestions noted but not blocking — proceeding to completion

---

## Task Review Iteration 1 - 2026-02-27T22:50:00+08:00

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 1: Change 4 "Step 2a" reference doesn't match actual SKILL.md structure (should be "Assemble context for dispatch" block) → Revised to reference actual block name
- [warning] Task 1: Change 5 "Step 2c" insertion point embeds I9 inside report-collection, should be between 2b and 2c → Revised to specify insertion between dispatch and collect
- [warning] Task 17: Loose grep `grep -l "Read"` matches prose, not frontmatter → Tightened to `grep -l "tools:.*Read"` and added frontmatter format note
- [warning] Task 18: "comparable quality" is subjective → Restated as binary criteria (non-blank JSON, no errors, no LAZY-LOAD-WARNING)
- [suggestion] Task 2: Done-when doesn't confirm spec remains inline as review target → Added explicit criterion
- [suggestion] Tasks 12, 15: implement.md PRD pattern variance not called out → Added note about `{content of prd.md or brainstorm file}` mapping to I8
- [suggestion] Task 16: grep tool not specified (grep vs rg) → Low-priority, both produce same result

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed Task 1 change 4: "Step 2a" → "Assemble context for dispatch block (under Step 2)"
- Fixed Task 1 change 5: "after implementer response (Step 2c)" → "between Step 2b (dispatch) and Step 2c (collect report)"
- Fixed Task 17: grep pattern tightened, frontmatter format specified
- Fixed Task 18: Done-when criteria made binary
- Added Task 2: review-target confirmation to Done-when
- Added Tasks 12, 15: PRD pattern variance notes

---

## Task Review Iteration 2 - 2026-02-27T23:00:00+08:00

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Tasks 2-3: Directive replacement text missing — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has exact before/after text in step 6 of each task; reviewer received condensed summary)
- [blocker] Tasks 4-5: "Stage 0 excluded" unexplained — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has explanation in Task 4 header)
- [blocker] Task 1: Insertion anchor missing — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has line references and 7 detailed changes)
- [blocker] Tasks 10-15: One-line summaries — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has detailed changes and done-when per task)
- [blocker] Task 16: Grep commands missing — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has both grep commands with expected false positives)
- [blocker] Task 17: Format unspecified — FALSE POSITIVE (full file has grep pattern and 11 agent names)
- [warning] Tasks 2-9: No explicit parallel group markers → Added parallel group note to Phase B header
- [warning] Task 18: Verification procedure missing → Added detailed 7-step procedure

**Changes Made:**
- Added explicit parallel group markers to Phase B section header
- Expanded Task 18 steps from 5 to 7 with specific procedure for testing both I8 paths
- All 6 blockers were false positives caused by prompt compression (reviewer received summary, not full file)
- Re-dispatching with complete tasks.md content

---

## Task Review Iteration 3 - 2026-02-27T23:10:00+08:00

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Task 16: Primary grep `\{.*content.*\.md\}` won't catch SKILL.md's reversed `{spec.md content}` form — false pass risk → Added second primary grep for reversed form
- [warning] Task 16: Secondary grep won't catch SKILL.md line 80's reversed prd pattern → Added `prd.*Problem Statement` alternative to secondary grep
- [warning] Task 1: Step 6 references "per TD4" without inline definition → Added inline TD4 explanation
- [suggestion] Task 16: "unexpected matches" undefined decision rule → Added concrete pass/fail decision rule
- [suggestion] Task 18: Read tool call UI description → Low-priority, existing description adequate

**Changes Made:**
- Task 16: Added second primary grep `grep -rE "\{[^}]*\.md[^}]*content\}" plugins/iflow/` for reversed form
- Task 16: Expanded secondary grep to include `prd.*Problem Statement` pattern
- Task 16: Added explicit decision rule: match in changed file = fail, match in excluded file = pass
- Task 1: Added inline TD4 definition to step 6 (extractSection preserves token-efficient scoping)

---

## Task Review Iteration 4 - 2026-02-27T23:25:00+08:00

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Tasks 2-15: I1/I8/I9 templates referenced by name but never reproduced — engineer cannot execute without design doc → Added "Shared Templates" section with I1, I8, I9 verbatim
- [blocker] Task 17: grep -l output is noisy (matches agents outside 11-agent list) and requires manual cross-referencing → Replaced with targeted per-agent loop script
- [warning] Task 1: Step 4 ambiguity between line 80 (prose assembly) and line 127 (dispatch template) — both reference PRD → Clarified both locations with explicit line numbers
- [warning] Task 16: Grep scoped to all of plugins/iflow/ produces excluded-file noise → Scoped grep to only the 6 changed files
- [warning] Task 18: No specification of test feature or transcript inspection method → Added concrete guidance

**Changes Made:**
- Added "Shared Templates" section between Overview and Phase A with I1, I8, I9 verbatim from design
- Task 1 step 4: Split into (a) line ~80 prose replacement and (b) lines ~126-127 template removal
- Task 16: Scoped all grep commands to explicit file list (6 changed files only)
- Task 17: Replaced `grep -l` with targeted per-agent loop producing OK/MISSING output
- Task 18: Added guidance on finding test feature and inspecting agent transcript

---

## Task Review Iteration 5 - 2026-02-27T23:45:00+08:00

**Decision:** Approved (at iteration cap 5/5, 1 warning remaining)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Shared Templates / I1: `{feature_path}` used as path variable but not explicitly defined in tasks.md — engineers must reference design.md I1 variable resolution section
- [suggestion] Task 17: grep will succeed for all 11 agents (all already have Read) — consider noting expected outcome
- [suggestion] Task 18: Step 6 "optionally repeat on a feature without prd.md" could be a separate optional task

**Changes Made:**
None — iteration cap reached. Warning noted in .meta.json taskReview.concerns.

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review Iteration 0 - 2026-02-27T23:55:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Shared Templates I1: `{feature_path}` not defined inline — implementers need to cross-reference design.md → Added inline definition sentence
- [warning] Task 17: grep pattern assumes inline bracket format, would miss YAML list form → Extended grep to cover both formats with explicit note

**Changes Made:**
- Added `{feature_path}` inline definition to I1 template block in Shared Templates
- Task 17: Extended grep to `grep -qE "(tools:.*Read|^  - Read)"` with explicit note about bracket format

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review Iteration 1 - 2026-02-28T00:00:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 1 steps 1-2, 4: Line-number anchors with no textual fallback — if lines drift, implementer can't locate patterns → Added exact string patterns alongside line numbers
- [suggestion] Task 18 step 1: Feature 030 listed as example but has no prd.md → Clarified 030 is for No-PRD path only

**Changes Made:**
- Task 1 steps 1-2: Added "look for the line containing `{spec.md content}`" and "look for `## PRD Context` followed by..." as textual anchors
- Task 1 step 4a: Added "Find the bullet `prd.md: extract ## Problem Statement...`" as textual anchor
- Task 18 step 1: Clarified feature 030 has no prd.md, use for optional step 6 only

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review Iteration 2 - 2026-02-28T00:10:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 1 step 4: Ambiguous where I8 conditional result goes (context assembly vs Required Artifacts) → Clarified: resolve_prd() output consumed by Required Artifacts block, not emitted separately
- [warning] Task 16 step 5: Secondary grep may not catch SKILL.md-specific pattern → Added note that SKILL.md bullet validated by Task 1 done-when; grep pattern `prd.*Problem Statement` covers the variant

**Changes Made:**
- Task 1 step 4(a): Added "the result is consumed by the Required Artifacts block (step 3), not emitted as a separate inline injection"
- Task 16 step 5: Added note explaining SKILL.md coverage via Task 1 done-when + grep pattern coverage

---

## Iteration 1 - 2026-02-28T01:30:00+08:00

**Implementation Review:** Approved
  - Level 1 (Tasks): pass
  - Level 2 (Spec): pass
  - Level 3 (Design): pass
  - Level 4 (PRD): pass
**Quality Review:** Issues found
**Security Review:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] [formatting] code-quality-reviewer: Step 7b code-quality-reviewer prompt uses "Return assessment with approval status." — plain prose without JSON schema, inconsistent with 7a, 7c, and all phase command dispatches (at: plugins/iflow/commands/implement.md:313)
  Suggestion: Add JSON schema example matching the other reviewers
- [suggestion] [completeness] code-quality-reviewer: create-plan.md Stage 1 FAIL branch missing explicit "Increment iteration counter" instruction (at: plugins/iflow/commands/create-plan.md:79-84)
- [suggestion] [consistency] code-quality-reviewer: test-deepener Phase A PRD ordering inconsistent — PRD listed last vs first in other blocks (at: plugins/iflow/commands/implement.md Step 6 Phase A)
- [suggestion] [consistency] code-quality-reviewer: I8 repetition in phase commands (cosmetic)

**Changes Made:**
- Added JSON return schema to code-quality-reviewer prompt in implement.md Step 7b, matching the pattern from phase command dispatches

---

## Iteration 2 - 2026-02-28T01:40:00+08:00

**Implementation Review:** Skipped (passed iter 1)
**Quality Review:** Issues found
**Security Review:** Skipped (passed iter 1)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [formatting] code-quality-reviewer: Step 7c security-reviewer uses plain prose 'Return JSON with approval status and vulnerabilities.' instead of explicit JSON schema — same defect as fixed in 7b (at: plugins/iflow/commands/implement.md:347)
  Suggestion: Add full JSON schema block matching the pattern used in 7b
- [suggestion] [flow] code-quality-reviewer: create-plan.md Stage 1 FAIL branch missing explicit "Increment iteration counter" step (at: plugins/iflow/commands/create-plan.md:79-81)
- [suggestion] [formatting] code-quality-reviewer: Step 7a implementation-reviewer also uses plain prose return format — lower priority but inconsistent within same command block (at: plugins/iflow/commands/implement.md:283)

**Changes Made:**
- Added JSON return schema to security-reviewer prompt in implement.md Step 7c

---

## Iteration 3 - 2026-02-28T01:50:00+08:00

**Implementation Review:** Skipped (passed iter 1)
**Quality Review:** Approved
**Security Review:** Skipped (passed iter 1)

**Issues:**
- [suggestion] [readability] code-quality-reviewer: create-plan.md Stage 1 FAIL branch missing "Increment iteration counter"
- [suggestion] [readability] code-quality-reviewer: Step 7a implementation-reviewer uses plain prose return format
- [suggestion] [readability] code-quality-reviewer: Test masking risk in global count comparison tests
- [suggestion] [kiss] code-quality-reviewer: Phase B awk subtraction is brittle

**Changes Made:**
None — suggestions only. Quality reviewer now approved.

---

## Iteration 4 - 2026-02-28T02:00:00+08:00 [FINAL VALIDATION]

**Implementation Review:** Approved (1 warning: R1 deferral to Phase 2 — known design decision, not an implementation gap)
  - Level 1 (Tasks): pass
  - Level 2 (Spec): pass (R1 deferral noted as design-accepted scope reduction)
  - Level 3 (Design): pass
  - Level 4 (PRD): pass
**Quality Review:** Approved
**Security Review:** Approved (0 issues)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [spec] implementation-reviewer: R1 (Agent Reuse via Resume) specified in spec.md R1.1-R1.8 but deferred to Phase 2 per design decision (GitHub #13619). Reviewer acknowledges: "this is a design-level scope reduction acknowledged in the design artifact" and "No action needed now." (at: spec.md R1.1-R1.8, design.md Phase 2 Architecture)
- [suggestion] [readability] code-quality-reviewer: I8 PRD resolution duplicated in 5 files — intentional for prompt templates
- [suggestion] [readability] code-quality-reviewer: "Fresh dispatch per iteration" note appears 10+ times
- [suggestion] [kiss] code-quality-reviewer: Phase B awk subtraction fragile in test
- [suggestion] [formatting] code-quality-reviewer: PRD ordering inconsistency in Phase A vs other blocks

**Decision:** APPROVED. The implementation-reviewer warning is about a documented Phase 2 deferral approved during the design review, not an implementation deficiency. All three reviewers approved with no actionable blockers or warnings.

**Changes Made:**
None — final validation passed.
