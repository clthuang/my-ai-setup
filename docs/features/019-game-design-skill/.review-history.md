## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T17:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (8 blockers, 5 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [testability] C1 SKILL.md output format vague — no exact section structure (at: C1 responsibilities item 4)
- [blocker] [testability] C1 review criteria output format unspecified (at: C1 responsibilities item 5)
- [blocker] [traceability] FR-11 implementation missing — no query construction mechanism for internet-researcher (at: FR-11)
- [blocker] [testability] C2 Stage 6 dispatch format lacks exact prompt template (at: C2 Stage 6 dispatch)
- [blocker] [testability] C3 existence check mechanism ambiguous (at: C3 brainstorm-reviewer)
- [blocker] [assumptions] C1 degradation — no critical vs optional file distinction (at: C1 responsibilities item 2)
- [blocker] [scope] BS-6 query construction mechanism missing (at: BS-6)
- [blocker] [traceability] FR-12 PRD section placement not in PRD template (at: FR-12)
- [warning] [testability] C4 line estimates are ranges, not verifiable thresholds (at: C4)
- [warning] [assumptions] BS-3 degradation not mapped to components (at: BS-3)
- [warning] [clarity] C2 mixes Stage 1, Stage 6, and PRD format changes under one heading (at: C2)
- [warning] [testability] Requirements Traceability table summarized not shown (at: Traceability)
- [warning] [feasibility] BS-4 domain/method interaction order unclear (at: BS-4)
- [suggestion] [clarity] C4.6 dimension examples missing (at: C4.6)
- [suggestion] [clarity] NFR-5 backward compatible undefined (at: NFR-5)

**Changes Made:**
- C1 responsibilities item 4: added exact markdown structure with field-level template for all 4 subsections
- C1 responsibilities item 2: changed to all-optional with graceful degradation (partial analysis from available files, STOP if all missing)
- C1 responsibilities item 5: added exact markdown format for domain review criteria output
- C2 restructured into C2.1 (Stage 1 Steps 9-10), C2.2 (Stage 2 query enhancement), C2.3 (Stage 6 dispatch), C2.4 (PRD format)
- C2.2 added: new section specifying how internet-researcher gets tech evaluation dimensions when domain is game-design
- C2.3 added: exact dispatch prompt format showing both domain-present and domain-absent cases
- C3 existence checks: added per-criterion mapping (criterion → subsection → keywords to check)
- C4.6: added dimension examples and phrasing guidance
- BS-4: added execution order (Steps 6-8 first, then 9-10) and PRD section order
- NFR-5: expanded with 3-point backward compatibility definition

## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-07T17:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] C2.2 Stage 2 modification lacks acceptance criteria for verifying domain context passed to internet-researcher (at: C2.2)
- [warning] C3 lacks error handling for malformed/empty domain criteria (at: C3)
- [warning] BS-3 doesn't specify behavior for SKILL.md Read permission/corruption errors (at: BS-3)
- [suggestion] C1 output structure could benefit from field-level acceptance criteria (at: C1 lines 34-68)
- [suggestion] C2.4 insertion logic should specify fallback when Structured Analysis is absent (at: C2.4)
- [suggestion] BS-4 should address Steps 9-10 behavior when Steps 6-8 are skipped (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
No changes — warnings and suggestions noted for iteration 2 to address.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-07T18:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (1 blocker, 5 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Temporal contradiction: Game Design Analysis written in Stage 1 Step 10 but references Stage 2 findings in Feasibility & Viability (at: C2.1 Step 10 vs C2.2)
- [warning] [assumptions] AskUserQuestion's 4-option limit claim is factually incorrect (at: C2.1 Step 9 line 106)
- [warning] [assumptions] Brainstorming SKILL.md is 483 lines not 482 — headroom is 17 not 18 (at: Open Questions)
- [warning] [clarity] C2.2 market data bullet conditionality unclear (at: C2.2)
- [warning] [testability] C3 keyword matching rules imprecise — no pass/fail threshold (at: C3)
- [warning] [scope] Out of Scope says Stages 3-5, 7 unchanged but Stage 3 writes new template (at: Scope Boundaries)
- [suggestion] [testability] FR-2 through FR-8 "contains" not structurally testable (at: Traceability)
- [suggestion] [clarity] C1 field labels exact match vs semantic unclear (at: C1 field-level criteria)
- [suggestion] [traceability] PRD Success Criterion #2 framework citation implicitly satisfied (at: C1)

**Changes Made:**
- C2.1 Step 10: Changed to two-phase write strategy — Step 10 stores analysis context, Stage 3 writes section to PRD after Stage 2 research
- C2 count: Fixed "Three" → "Four" modification points
- Removed incorrect 4-option limit claim from C2.1 Step 9
- Updated line count to 483/500 with 17 lines headroom
- C2.2: Clarified market data bullet always included when domain is game-design; evaluate dimensions bullet conditional on tech-evaluation-criteria.md
- C3: Added explicit keyword lists per criterion with case-insensitive substring match rule
- Out of Scope: Clarified Stage 3 writes updated template but requires no logic changes
- C4: Added structural note (H2 headings per topic, internal formatting at implementer discretion)
- C4.7: Clarified source of truth (SKILL.md hardcodes, review-criteria.md documents)
- C1: Added framework citation note and field label format clarification
- BS-4: Added full PRD section order including Open Questions and Next Steps

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-07T18:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 1 suggestion)

**Issues:**
- [warning] C2 introductory text says "Three" but has 4 subsections (at: C2 line 86)
- [warning] Stage 1 vs Stage 2 sequencing for Game Design Analysis writing (at: C2.1 Step 10 and C2.2)
- [warning] Review criteria source of truth unclear between C1 #5 and C4.7 (at: C1 vs C4.7)
- [suggestion] Full PRD section order should include Open Questions and Next Steps (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (4 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumptions] Stage 3 merge responsibility wording could mislead (at: Scope Boundaries Out of Scope)
- [warning] [testability] FR-2 through FR-7 "contains" not linked to C4 H2 structural rule (at: Traceability)
- [warning] [clarity] C3 keyword "feel" could match incidentally — mitigated by subsection scoping (at: C3)
- [warning] [assumptions] Domain criteria warning severity not explicitly linked to approved boolean (at: C3, BS-7)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Loop-back should clear stored domain context (at: C2.1)
- [suggestion] [traceability] PRD Success Criterion #2 framework citation satisfied by construction (at: C1)
- [suggestion] [testability] NFR-3 tight but feasible with documented fallback (at: Open Questions)

**Changes Made:**
- Out of Scope: Reworded to explicitly mention merging Step 10 analysis with Stage 2 data
- C2.1 loop-back: Extended to clear domain context and re-prompt user
- C2.1 Step 10: Added inline execution clarification (not sub-agent)
- C3: Added domain warning severity note (doesn't affect approved boolean)
- C1: Added enforcement boundary note (SKILL.md enforces field-level, C3 checks subsection existence only)

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

- [warning] Step 10 invocation mechanism ambiguous — inline Read or sub-agent (at: C2.1 line 114)
- [warning] Loop-back re-prompt vs reuse of domain selection unclear (at: C2.1 line 122)
- [warning] BS-4 PRD section order should be verified against actual template (at: BS-4 line 322)
- [suggestion] Field-level criteria enforcement boundary unclear (at: C1 lines 61-66)
- [suggestion] Game concept context passing mechanism unspecified (at: C1 line 28)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.
