- [warning] BS-3 doesn't specify behavior for SKILL.md Read permission/corruption errors (at: BS-3)
- [suggestion] C1 output structure could benefit from field-level acceptance criteria (at: C1 lines 34-68)
- [suggestion] C2.4 insertion logic should specify fallback when Structured Analysis is absent (at: C2.4)
- [suggestion] BS-4 should address Steps 9-10 behavior when Steps 6-8 are skipped (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
No changes — warnings and suggestions noted for iteration 2 to address.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-07T18:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (1 blocker, 5 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Temporal contradiction: Game Design Analysis written in Stage 1 Step 10 but references Stage 2 findings in Feasibility & Viability (at: C2.1 Step 10 vs C2.2)
- [warning] [assumptions] AskUserQuestion's 4-option limit claim is factually incorrect (at: C2.1 Step 9 line 106)
- [warning] [assumptions] Brainstorming SKILL.md is 483 lines not 482 — headroom is 17 not 18 (at: Open Questions)
- [warning] [clarity] C2.2 market data bullet conditionality unclear (at: C2.2)
- [warning] [testability] C3 keyword matching rules imprecise — no pass/fail threshold (at: C3)
- [warning] [scope] Out of Scope says Stages 3-5, 7 unchanged but Stage 3 writes new template (at: Scope Boundaries)
- [suggestion] [testability] FR-2 through FR-8 "contains" not structurally testable (at: Traceability)
- [suggestion] [clarity] C1 field labels exact match vs semantic unclear (at: C1 field-level criteria)
- [suggestion] [traceability] PRD Success Criterion #2 framework citation implicitly satisfied (at: C1)

**Changes Made:**
- C2.1 Step 10: Changed to two-phase write strategy — Step 10 stores analysis context, Stage 3 writes section to PRD after Stage 2 research
- C2 count: Fixed "Three" → "Four" modification points
- Removed incorrect 4-option limit claim from C2.1 Step 9
- Updated line count to 483/500 with 17 lines headroom
- C2.2: Clarified market data bullet always included when domain is game-design; evaluate dimensions bullet conditional on tech-evaluation-criteria.md
- C3: Added explicit keyword lists per criterion with case-insensitive substring match rule
- Out of Scope: Clarified Stage 3 writes updated template but requires no logic changes
- C4: Added structural note (H2 headings per topic, internal formatting at implementer discretion)
- C4.7: Clarified source of truth (SKILL.md hardcodes, review-criteria.md documents)
- C1: Added framework citation note and field label format clarification
- BS-4: Added full PRD section order including Open Questions and Next Steps

- [warning] Stage 1 vs Stage 2 sequencing for Game Design Analysis writing (at: C2.1 Step 10 and C2.2)
- [warning] Review criteria source of truth unclear between C1 #5 and C4.7 (at: C1 vs C4.7)
- [suggestion] Full PRD section order should include Open Questions and Next Steps (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (4 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumptions] Stage 3 merge responsibility wording could mislead (at: Scope Boundaries Out of Scope)
- [warning] [testability] FR-2 through FR-7 "contains" not linked to C4 H2 structural rule (at: Traceability)
- [warning] [clarity] C3 keyword "feel" could match incidentally — mitigated by subsection scoping (at: C3)
- [warning] [assumptions] Domain criteria warning severity not explicitly linked to approved boolean (at: C3, BS-7)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Loop-back should clear stored domain context (at: C2.1)
- [suggestion] [traceability] PRD Success Criterion #2 framework citation satisfied by construction (at: C1)

---

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 10 invocation mechanism ambiguous — inline Read or sub-agent (at: C2.1 line 114)
- [warning] Loop-back re-prompt vs reuse of domain selection unclear (at: C2.1 line 122)
- [warning] BS-4 PRD section order should be verified against actual template (at: BS-4 line 322)
- [suggestion] Field-level criteria enforcement boundary unclear (at: C1 lines 61-66)
- [suggestion] Game concept context passing mechanism unspecified (at: C1 line 28)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-07T19:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (1 blocker, 5 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Field-level enforcement gap — no mechanism to verify SKILL.md produces correct field-level output (at: C1 enforcement boundary)
- [warning] [clarity] Context passing mechanism between brainstorming and game-design skill unspecified (at: C1 line 28)
- [warning] [assumptions] Keyword scope relies on markdown heading parsing (at: C3 existence check)
- [warning] [clarity] SKILL.md inline execution vs sub-agent dispatch still ambiguous in Step 10 (at: C2.1 Step 10)
- [warning] [clarity] Stage 3 merge mechanism imprecise — how are Step 10 and Stage 2 data combined (at: C2.1 two-phase write)
- [warning] [testability] FR-11 dimension injection format — placeholder text vs actual dimensions (at: FR-11)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Core Loop 3-layer model needs definitions per layer in C4.1 (at: C4.1)
- [suggestion] [testability] FR-12 placement acceptance criteria could specify both scenarios (at: FR-12)

**Changes Made:**
- C1 enforcement boundary: Added 3-tier enforcement model (SKILL.md instructions → C3 structural safety net → human review at Stage 7)
- C1 context passing: Added explicit note that context is available from conversation history since SKILL.md executes inline
- C2.1 Step 10: Clarified "executed in the brainstorming agent's context, not dispatched as a sub-agent"
- C2.1 two-phase write: Added explicit merge steps (subsections 1-3 from Step 10, subsection 4 merges Step 10 + Stage 2)
- C2.2: Added degradation link to C1 graceful degradation for dimension injection
- C2.2 dimension injection: Added example showing actual dimension text replacement
- C3 existence check: Added H3 heading structure and markdown template guarantee note
- FR-11: Updated component reference to C4.6 + C2.2, made acceptance criteria more precise
- C4.1: Added "with definitions and examples per layer" to 3-layer model description

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-07T19:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (1 suggestion)

**Issues:**
- [suggestion] Cross-reference C2.2 to C1 degradation for file-loading tracking mechanism (at: C2.2)

**Changes Made:**
- C2.2: Added "Degradation link" paragraph cross-referencing C1 graceful degradation when tech-evaluation-criteria.md not loaded

---

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-07T19:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [feasibility] NFR-3 line budget underestimates total additions — ~35-44 lines across all C2 modifications, not just ~15-17 for Steps 9-10; viable via whitespace trimming (133 blank lines) (at: Open Questions)
- [warning] [clarity] Out of Scope contradicts itself — Stage 3 merge behavior is described in parenthetical as out of scope but is actually in scope (at: Scope Boundaries)
- [warning] [testability] FR-12 conditional placement needs two separate Given/When/Then scenarios (at: FR-12)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Two-phase write strategy relies on conversation context across stages — context pressure fallback not documented (at: C2.1)
- [suggestion] [traceability] No acceptance criterion verifies PRD output does NOT contain static platform recommendations (at: Success Criterion 3 → FR-12)

**Changes Made:**
- Open Questions: Updated line budget to account for all 4 modification points (total ~35-44 lines) with whitespace trimming feasibility note
- Scope Boundaries: Moved Stage 2 and Stage 3 format changes to In Scope; Out of Scope now cleanly covers control flow only
- FR-12: Split into FR-12a (Structured Analysis present) and FR-12b (Structured Analysis absent)
- Two-phase write strategy: Added context pressure fallback note (temporary scratch section)
- BS-4: Added pre-modification line number reference note
- C4.7: Clarified C3 keyword authority (spec's C3 is implementation spec; review-criteria.md is documentation)

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-07T19:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] PRD says 482 lines, spec says 483 — spec is correct, PRD is stale (at: Open Questions vs PRD line 113)
- [warning] Stage 3 merge behavior described across C2.1 and Out of Scope parenthetical — designer can infer but could be clearer (at: C2.1 and Scope Boundaries)
- [warning] AskUserQuestion future domains note doesn't mention 4-option cap (at: C2.1 Step 9 line 109)
- [suggestion] C3 keyword lists vs review-criteria.md authority unclear when they diverge (at: C3 vs C4.7)
- [suggestion] BS-4 line number references may shift after modification (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
- Stage 3 merge: Moved to In Scope (addressed in spec-reviewer fixes above)
- C4.7: Added C3 keyword authority clarification
- BS-4: Added pre-modification line number note

## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T20:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (5 warnings, 2 notes)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] Prior Art claims game-design "replicates" structured-problem-solving degradation pattern, but game-design uses richer per-file degradation (at: Prior Art Research > Graceful degradation)
  Challenge: Clarify that game-design extends the pattern to per-file warnings
- [warning] [completeness] I-7 loop-back cleanup does not specify owning component or three discrete actions (at: Interfaces > I-7)
  Challenge: Which component owns I-7? What are the three actions and ordering?
- [warning] [completeness] Stage 3 merge does not specify fallback when Stage 2 returns no platform/engine data (at: Architecture Overview > Data flow step 3)
  Challenge: What does Platform Considerations contain when research is empty?
- [warning] [assumptions] R-2 context window pressure rated "Low" but unquantified — no token estimate (at: Risks > R-2)
  Challenge: Has full context usage been estimated?
- [warning] [consistency] C3 component description does not reference keyword lists — implementer wouldn't know which keywords to check (at: Components > C3)
  Challenge: Where does the implementer find keyword lists?
- [note] [completeness] C2.4 PRD template and conditional placement logic not detailed in design (at: Components > C2 / Interfaces > I-4)
- [note] [complexity] Two-phase write (TD-2) adds cognitive complexity but is the simplest valid approach (at: TD-2)

**Changes Made:**
- Prior Art: Clarified game-design uses per-file degradation extending structured-problem-solving's blanket pattern
- I-7: Added explicit owner (C2.1), three discrete ordered actions (delete, clear, re-prompt)
- I-4: Added empty research fallback for Platform Considerations
- R-2: Added token estimate (~8000 tokens) and concrete scratch section fallback
- C3: Added explicit reference to spec C3 keyword lists and I-6 lookup table
- I-4: Added FR-12a/FR-12b labels to conditional placement logic

## Handoff Review - 2026-02-07T20:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (2 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Line count discrepancy: design says 483/500, actual file is 482 lines (at: Components > C2)
- [warning] C3 component section sparse on insertion point within brainstorm-reviewer.md (at: Components > C3)
- [suggestion] I-7 loop-back missing error handling for Edit failure (at: Interfaces > I-7)
- [suggestion] No explicit implementation order for 4 C2 modification points (at: Components > C2)

**Changes Made:**
- C3: Added insertion point note ("after existing Problem Type parsing, around line 109")
- I-7: Added error handling for Edit failure ("warn and proceed, section overwritten by Stage 3 regardless")
