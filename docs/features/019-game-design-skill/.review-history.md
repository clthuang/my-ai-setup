## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T17:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (8 blockers, 5 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [testability] C1 SKILL.md output format vague — no exact section structure (at: C1 responsibilities item 4)
- [blocker] [testability] C1 review criteria output format unspecified (at: C1 responsibilities item 5)
- [blocker] [traceability] FR-11 implementation missing — no query construction mechanism for internet-researcher (at: FR-11)
- [blocker] [testability] C2 Stage 6 dispatch format lacks exact prompt template (at: C2 Stage 6 dispatch)
- [blocker] [testability] C3 existence check mechanism ambiguous (at: C3 brainstorm-reviewer)
- [blocker] [assumptions] C1 degradation — no critical vs optional file distinction (at: C1 responsibilities item 2)
- [blocker] [scope] BS-6 query construction mechanism missing (at: BS-6)
- [blocker] [traceability] FR-12 PRD section placement not in PRD template (at: FR-12)
- [warning] [testability] C4 line estimates are ranges, not verifiable thresholds (at: C4)
- [warning] [assumptions] BS-3 degradation not mapped to components (at: BS-3)
- [warning] [clarity] C2 mixes Stage 1, Stage 6, and PRD format changes under one heading (at: C2)
- [warning] [testability] Requirements Traceability table summarized not shown (at: Traceability)
- [warning] [feasibility] BS-4 domain/method interaction order unclear (at: BS-4)
- [suggestion] [clarity] C4.6 dimension examples missing (at: C4.6)
- [suggestion] [clarity] NFR-5 backward compatible undefined (at: NFR-5)

**Changes Made:**
- C1 responsibilities item 4: added exact markdown structure with field-level template for all 4 subsections
- C1 responsibilities item 2: changed to all-optional with graceful degradation (partial analysis from available files, STOP if all missing)
- C1 responsibilities item 5: added exact markdown format for domain review criteria output
- C2 restructured into C2.1 (Stage 1 Steps 9-10), C2.2 (Stage 2 query enhancement), C2.3 (Stage 6 dispatch), C2.4 (PRD format)
- C2.2 added: new section specifying how internet-researcher gets tech evaluation dimensions when domain is game-design
- C2.3 added: exact dispatch prompt format showing both domain-present and domain-absent cases
- C3 existence checks: added per-criterion mapping (criterion → subsection → keywords to check)
- C4.6: added dimension examples and phrasing guidance
- BS-4: added execution order (Steps 6-8 first, then 9-10) and PRD section order
- NFR-5: expanded with 3-point backward compatibility definition

## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-07T17:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] C2.2 Stage 2 modification lacks acceptance criteria for verifying domain context passed to internet-researcher (at: C2.2)
- [warning] C3 lacks error handling for malformed/empty domain criteria (at: C3)
- [warning] BS-3 doesn't specify behavior for SKILL.md Read permission/corruption errors (at: BS-3)
- [suggestion] C1 output structure could benefit from field-level acceptance criteria (at: C1 lines 34-68)
- [suggestion] C2.4 insertion logic should specify fallback when Structured Analysis is absent (at: C2.4)
- [suggestion] BS-4 should address Steps 9-10 behavior when Steps 6-8 are skipped (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
No changes — warnings and suggestions noted for design phase to address.
