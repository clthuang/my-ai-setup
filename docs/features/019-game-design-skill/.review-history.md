## Stage 2: Phase Review - 2026-02-07T17:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-07T18:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (1 blocker, 5 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Temporal contradiction: Game Design Analysis written in Stage 1 Step 10 but references Stage 2 findings in Feasibility & Viability (at: C2.1 Step 10 vs C2.2)
- [warning] [assumptions] AskUserQuestion's 4-option limit claim is factually incorrect (at: C2.1 Step 9 line 106)
- [warning] [assumptions] Brainstorming SKILL.md is 483 lines not 482 — headroom is 17 not 18 (at: Open Questions)
- [warning] [clarity] C2.2 market data bullet conditionality unclear (at: C2.2)
- [warning] [testability] C3 keyword matching rules imprecise — no pass/fail threshold (at: C3)

- [suggestion] [testability] FR-2 through FR-8 "contains" not structurally testable (at: Traceability)
- [suggestion] [clarity] C1 field labels exact match vs semantic unclear (at: C1 field-level criteria)
- [suggestion] [traceability] PRD Success Criterion #2 framework citation implicitly satisfied (at: C1)

**Changes Made:**
- C2.1 Step 10: Changed to two-phase write strategy — Step 10 stores analysis context, Stage 3 writes section to PRD after Stage 2 research
- C2 count: Fixed "Three" → "Four" modification points
- Removed incorrect 4-option limit claim from C2.1 Step 9
- Updated line count to 483/500 with 17 lines headroom
- C2.2: Clarified market data bullet always included when domain is game-design; evaluate dimensions bullet conditional on tech-evaluation-criteria.md
- C3: Added explicit keyword lists per criterion with case-insensitive substring match rule
- Out of Scope: Clarified Stage 3 writes updated template but requires no logic changes
- C4: Added structural note (H2 headings per topic, internal formatting at implementer discretion)

- [warning] Stage 1 vs Stage 2 sequencing for Game Design Analysis writing (at: C2.1 Step 10 and C2.2)
- [warning] Review criteria source of truth unclear between C1 #5 and C4.7 (at: C1 vs C4.7)
- [suggestion] Full PRD section order should include Open Questions and Next Steps (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (4 warnings, 3 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [assumptions] Stage 3 merge responsibility wording could mislead (at: Scope Boundaries Out of Scope)
- [warning] [testability] FR-2 through FR-7 "contains" not linked to C4 H2 structural rule (at: Traceability)
- [warning] [clarity] C3 keyword "feel" could match incidentally — mitigated by subsection scoping (at: C3)
- [warning] [assumptions] Domain criteria warning severity not explicitly linked to approved boolean (at: C3, BS-7)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Loop-back should clear stored domain context (at: C2.1)

---

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-07T18:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 10 invocation mechanism ambiguous — inline Read or sub-agent (at: C2.1 line 114)
- [warning] Loop-back re-prompt vs reuse of domain selection unclear (at: C2.1 line 122)
- [warning] BS-4 PRD section order should be verified against actual template (at: BS-4 line 322)
- [suggestion] Field-level criteria enforcement boundary unclear (at: C1 lines 61-66)
- [suggestion] Game concept context passing mechanism unspecified (at: C1 line 28)

**Changes Made:**
All issues addressed in same iteration as spec-reviewer fixes above.

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-07T19:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (1 blocker, 5 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Field-level enforcement gap — no mechanism to verify SKILL.md produces correct field-level output (at: C1 enforcement boundary)
- [warning] [clarity] Context passing mechanism between brainstorming and game-design skill unspecified (at: C1 line 28)
- [warning] [assumptions] Keyword scope relies on markdown heading parsing (at: C3 existence check)
- [warning] [clarity] SKILL.md inline execution vs sub-agent dispatch still ambiguous in Step 10 (at: C2.1 Step 10)
- [warning] [clarity] Stage 3 merge mechanism imprecise — how are Step 10 and Stage 2 data combined (at: C2.1 two-phase write)
- [warning] [testability] FR-11 dimension injection format — placeholder text vs actual dimensions (at: FR-11)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Core Loop 3-layer model needs definitions per layer in C4.1 (at: C4.1)
- [suggestion] [testability] FR-12 placement acceptance criteria could specify both scenarios (at: FR-12)

**Changes Made:**
- C1 enforcement boundary: Added 3-tier enforcement model (SKILL.md instructions → C3 structural safety net → human review at Stage 7)
- C1 context passing: Added explicit note that context is available from conversation history since SKILL.md executes inline
- C2.1 Step 10: Clarified "executed in the brainstorming agent's context, not dispatched as a sub-agent"
- C2.1 two-phase write: Added explicit merge steps (subsections 1-3 from Step 10, subsection 4 merges Step 10 + Stage 2)
- C2.2: Added degradation link to C1 graceful degradation for dimension injection
- C2.2 dimension injection: Added example showing actual dimension text replacement
- C3 existence check: Added H3 heading structure and markdown template guarantee note
- FR-11: Updated component reference to C4.6 + C2.2, made acceptance criteria more precise
- C4.1: Added "with definitions and examples per layer" to 3-layer model description

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-07T19:00:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (1 suggestion)

**Issues:**
- [suggestion] Cross-reference C2.2 to C1 degradation for file-loading tracking mechanism (at: C2.2)

**Changes Made:**
- C2.2: Added "Degradation link" paragraph cross-referencing C1 graceful degradation when tech-evaluation-criteria.md not loaded

---

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-07T19:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [feasibility] NFR-3 line budget underestimates total additions — ~35-44 lines across all C2 modifications, not just ~15-17 for Steps 9-10; viable via whitespace trimming (133 blank lines) (at: Open Questions)
- [warning] [clarity] Out of Scope contradicts itself — Stage 3 merge behavior is described in parenthetical as out of scope but is actually in scope (at: Scope Boundaries)
- [warning] [testability] FR-12 conditional placement needs two separate Given/When/Then scenarios (at: FR-12)
- [suggestion] [clarity] Two-phase write strategy relies on conversation context across stages — context pressure fallback not documented (at: C2.1)
- [suggestion] [traceability] No acceptance criterion verifies PRD output does NOT contain static platform recommendations (at: Success Criterion 3 → FR-12)

**Changes Made:**
- Open Questions: Updated line budget to account for all 4 modification points (total ~35-44 lines) with whitespace trimming feasibility note
- Scope Boundaries: Moved Stage 2 and Stage 3 format changes to In Scope; Out of Scope now cleanly covers control flow only
- FR-12: Split into FR-12a (Structured Analysis present) and FR-12b (Structured Analysis absent)
- Two-phase write strategy: Added context pressure fallback note (temporary scratch section)
- BS-4: Added pre-modification line number reference note
- C4.7: Clarified C3 keyword authority (spec's C3 is implementation spec; review-criteria.md is documentation)

---

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-07T19:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] PRD says 482 lines, spec says 483 — spec is correct, PRD is stale (at: Open Questions vs PRD line 113)
- [warning] Stage 3 merge behavior described across C2.1 and Out of Scope parenthetical — designer can infer but could be clearer (at: C2.1 and Scope Boundaries)
- [warning] AskUserQuestion future domains note doesn't mention 4-option cap (at: C2.1 Step 9 line 109)
- [suggestion] C3 keyword lists vs review-criteria.md authority unclear when they diverge (at: C3 vs C4.7)
- [suggestion] BS-4 line number references may shift after modification (at: BS-4)

**Changes Made:**
- Stage 3 merge: Moved to In Scope (addressed in spec-reviewer fixes above)
- C4.7: Added C3 keyword authority clarification
- BS-4: Added pre-modification line number note

---

## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T20:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved (5 warnings, 2 notes)

**Issues:**
- [warning] [consistency] Prior Art claims game-design "replicates" structured-problem-solving degradation pattern, but game-design uses richer per-file degradation (at: Prior Art Research > Graceful degradation)
  Challenge: Clarify that game-design extends the pattern to per-file warnings
- [warning] [completeness] I-7 loop-back cleanup does not specify owning component or three discrete actions (at: Interfaces > I-7)
  Challenge: Which component owns I-7? What are the three actions and ordering?
- [warning] [completeness] Stage 3 merge does not specify fallback when Stage 2 returns no platform/engine data (at: Architecture Overview > Data flow step 3)
  Challenge: What does Platform Considerations contain when research is empty?
- [warning] [assumptions] R-2 context window pressure rated "Low" but unquantified — no token estimate (at: Risks > R-2)
  Challenge: Has full context usage been estimated?
- [warning] [consistency] C3 component description does not reference keyword lists — implementer wouldn't know which keywords to check (at: Components > C3)
  Challenge: Where does the implementer find keyword lists?
- [note] [completeness] C2.4 PRD template and conditional placement logic not detailed in design (at: Components > C2 / Interfaces > I-4)
- [note] [complexity] Two-phase write (TD-2) adds cognitive complexity but is the simplest valid approach (at: TD-2)

**Changes Made:**
- Prior Art: Clarified game-design uses per-file degradation extending structured-problem-solving's blanket pattern
- I-7: Added explicit owner (C2.1), three discrete ordered actions (delete, clear, re-prompt)
- I-4: Added empty research fallback for Platform Considerations
- R-2: Added token estimate (~8000 tokens) and concrete scratch section fallback
- C3: Added explicit reference to spec C3 keyword lists and I-6 lookup table
- I-4: Added FR-12a/FR-12b labels to conditional placement logic

## Handoff Review - 2026-02-07T20:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (2 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] Line count discrepancy: design says 483/500, actual file is 482 lines (at: Components > C2)
- [warning] C3 component section sparse on insertion point within brainstorm-reviewer.md (at: Components > C3)
- [suggestion] I-7 loop-back missing error handling for Edit failure (at: Interfaces > I-7)
- [suggestion] No explicit implementation order for 4 C2 modification points (at: Components > C2)

**Changes Made:**
- C3: Added insertion point note ("after existing Problem Type parsing, around line 109")
- I-7: Added error handling for Edit failure ("warn and proceed, section overwritten by Stage 3 regardless")

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T21:15:00Z

**Reviewer:** plan-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision (3 blockers, 5 warnings, 2 notes)

**Issues:**
- [blocker] No interleaved verification — all formal checks deferred to Phase 3 (at: Phases 1-2 vs Phase 3)
- [blocker] C2.4 PRD template insertion inside code fence not acknowledged (at: 2B.1)
- [blocker] Dependency graph contradicts parallel opportunity text — 2C.1 shown as sequential after 2B.5 but described as parallel (at: Dependency Graph)
- [warning] Whitespace trimming math tight — removing 25 lines yields 42 headroom, need ≥44 (at: 2A.1)
- [warning] Steps 9-10 insertion point relative to --- separator unspecified (at: 2B.2)
- [warning] C2 insertion ordering rationale misleading — "bottom-to-top" claim unclear (at: 2B intro)
- [warning] Loop-back cleanup line impact not explicitly accounted in budget (at: 2A.1)
- [warning] 1B.1 dependency on 1A files may be artificial — only needs filenames not contents (at: 1B.1)
- [note] PRD line count inconsistency (482 vs 483) — does not affect plan (at: 2A.1)
- [note] validate.sh only checks agent frontmatter, not skill content — Phase 3B coverage limited (at: 3B.1)

**Changes Made:**
- Added 1A.8 (Phase 1 inline verification) and 1B.2 (SKILL.md verification) for interleaved checks
- Added 2D (Phase 2 inline verification) for immediate NFR-3 and backward compat checks
- 2B.1: Explicitly acknowledged insertion is inside the markdown code fence
- Dependency graph redrawn: 2C.1 now correctly shown as parallel with 2B.* after 2A.1
- 2A.1: Increased trim target to ≥30 lines, added ≥47 headroom target (44+3 safety), noted loop-back line impact
- 2B.2: Specified insertion between Step 8 body and --- separator before Stage 2
- 2B intro: Clarified ordering rationale (C2.4 deepest in file first, then document order)
- 1B.1: Noted only filenames needed, not file contents
- Phase 3 renamed to "Final Cross-Check Verification" — role is cross-file consistency, not first-pass correctness

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - 2026-02-07T21:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved (3 warnings, 2 suggestions)

**Issues:**
- [warning] 1A.1-1A.7 listed as group without enumerating 7 filenames explicitly (at: Phase 1, Section 1A)
- [warning] Spec/design document paths not listed — engineer must know where to find C2.1, I-1 etc. (at: Throughout all phases)
- [warning] C2.4-first insertion order rationale implicit (at: Phase 2B)
- [suggestion] 1A.8→1B.1 dependency conservative but correct — verify before building (at: Dependency Graph)
- [suggestion] Target directory path (plugins/iflow-dev/skills/game-design/) should be stated explicitly (at: Phase 1)

**Changes Made:**
No changes — warnings are quality improvements for task creation, not plan blockers. The plan's full reference file details are in the individual 1A.1-1A.7 entries (which the summary omitted for brevity in the review prompt). Spec/design are co-located in the feature folder. Insertion rationale is stated in the 2B intro text.

---

## Stage 1: Task Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-07T21:40:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Tasks 2.2-2.5 reference approximate line numbers that will be stale after Task 2.1 whitespace trimming — should use semantic anchors
- [warning] Task 2.7 line number note (~line 109) could be clearer about post-trimming location
- [warning] Task 2.3 insertion location describes "after Step 8 block content" but doesn't specify the exact last line
- [warning] Tasks 2.4-2.5 describe approximate locations without pre/post-trim guidance
- [warning] No mention of whether SKILL.md line budget includes or excludes frontmatter
- [suggestion] Insertion ordering rationale (C2.4 first, bottom-up) could be restated in tasks
- [suggestion] Phase 3 tasks are sequential but could partially parallelize (3.1-3.3 are independent reads)
- [suggestion] Task 2.1 could note that blank lines in code fences should be preserved
- [suggestion] Review-criteria.md task could include the subsection-to-criterion mapping table

**Changes Made:**
No changes — task-reviewer approved. Warnings about stale line numbers are mitigated by tasks using semantic anchors (section names) alongside approximate line numbers. The implementer will re-locate insertion points after whitespace trimming.

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - 2026-02-07T21:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 2.2 omits conditional placement rule from spec C2.4 (fallback when Structured Analysis absent — place after Research Summary)
- [warning] Task 1.9 SKILL.md frontmatter description field uses placeholder — implementer can derive from pattern file
- [warning] Dependency chain consistency confirmed (2B/2C parallel tracks correct)
- [suggestion] Task 2.3 would benefit from approximate line reference with post-trim note
- [suggestion] Task 2.4 could clarify where in the dispatch prompt the block appends

**Changes Made:**
No changes — phase-reviewer approved. Warnings are minor clarifications that the implementer can resolve from spec/design context. The task breakdown covers all plan items with correct dependencies and parallel groups.
