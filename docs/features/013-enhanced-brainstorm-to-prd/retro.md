# Retrospective: Enhanced Brainstorm-to-PRD Workflow

## What Went Well
- Clear requirements upfront: User clarified goals, evidence standards, and quality criteria early in brainstorm
- Subagent design pattern: Delegating research to parallel subagents (internet, codebase, skills) worked well
- All phases completed in single iteration - no rework needed
- Quality review scored 9/10 with only minor suggestions

## What Could Improve
- Nothing significant - feature went smoothly

## Learnings Captured
- Added to patterns.md: Parallel Subagent Delegation for Independent Research
- Added to patterns.md: Evidence-Backed Claims in Documentation

## Action Items
- None - feature complete
