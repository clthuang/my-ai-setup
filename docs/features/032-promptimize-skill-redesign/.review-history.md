## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-28T13:25:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [completeness] Skill-to-command data return mechanism undefined (at: Architecture Overview / I5 Step 3)
- [blocker] [feasibility] "Deterministic computation" is LLM-interpreted — commands are Markdown, not code (at: Architecture Overview, C3-C10, TD1)
- [blocker] [completeness] Drift detection edge cases unspecified — file start/end, adjacent blocks (at: C6)
- [blocker] [completeness] Merge algorithm unclear — no concrete walkthrough (at: C9 Step 4)
- [warning] [feasibility] Byte-identical vs normalization-identical terminology contradiction (at: C2, C6)
- [warning] [assumptions] Target file containing XML-like patterns could cause false positives (at: TD2, C5)
- [warning] [consistency] All-pass Phase 2 is a no-op but still runs (at: C2, C8, R4.5)
- [warning] [completeness] original_content not explicitly read by command (at: C6, C9, I5)
- [warning] [completeness] Token counting method undefined (at: C7, R5.3)
- [warning] [completeness] YOLO mode section removal from skill not in File Change Summary (at: C1/C2, C8)
- [suggestion] [completeness] Dimension name mapping table missing (at: I2)
- [suggestion] [complexity] Component labels clarification needed (at: Components section)

**Changes Made:**
Added execution model and data flow paragraphs. Added TD6 honest framing. C6 edge cases. C9 concrete walkthrough. Fixed preservation language. C5 code fence skipping. All-pass no-op note. Step 2.5 for original_content. Token budget word count proxy. YOLO section removal. Dimension mapping table. Implementation note.

## Design Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-28T13:35:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [completeness] YOLO mode detection for Step 8 approval not specified (at: C8, I5)
- [warning] [completeness] Regex attribute ordering strict — LLM may reorder (at: TD2)
- [warning] [completeness] C9 Step 9 residual tag strip is defensive but undocumented (at: C9)
- [warning] [consistency] C2 vs I6 preservation language inconsistent (at: C2, I6)
- [warning] [feasibility] Adjacent block merge mapping to original underspecified (at: C6)
- [warning] [assumptions] Context-line availability between blocks not guaranteed (at: C6, C9)
- [suggestion] [completeness] PROHIBITED section handling missing from File Change Summary (at: File Change Summary)
- [suggestion] [completeness] Step 2.5 file-read error handling missing (at: I5)

**Changes Made:**
Added explicit [YOLO_MODE] check in C8. TD2 known constraint for attribute ordering. Defensive parenthetical on C9 Step 9. I6 language aligned to content-equivalent. Adjacent block span comparison clarified. Zero-context-lines structural limitation acknowledged. PROHIBITED section in File Change Summary. Step 2.5 error handling.

## Design Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-28T13:45:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [suggestion] [consistency] I1 example still says "byte-identical" (cosmetic)
- [suggestion] [completeness] C6 "file start and file end" parenthetical slightly ambiguous

**Changes Made:**
Updated I1 example to "content-equivalent". Updated C6 parenthetical to "blank-line runs at the start and end of the file".

## Handoff Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-28T14:00:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Step 2.5 ambiguous whether original_content is fresh read or reuse from selection (at: I5)
- [warning] Attribute order enforcement mechanism not specified — implementer may produce weak LLM instruction (at: TD2, I3)
- [suggestion] C9 walkthrough Block A uses 1 before-context line without explaining near-file-start edge case (at: C9)

**Changes Made:**
Step 2.5 clarified as fresh read (selection only identifies path, not content). I3 Attributes section gains explicit SKILL.md enforcement note with example and rule wording. C9 walkthrough Block A parenthetical added referencing C6 edge cases.

## Handoff Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-28T14:10:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Attribute order enforcement should be a named implementation item, not implied by general rewrite (at: TD2, I3)
- [warning] Zero-context degradation needs distinct user-facing warning message (at: C6, C8)
- [suggestion] original_content naming should be consistent across all steps (at: I5)

**Changes Made:**
I3 enforcement note updated to "critical implementation detail" with explicit named-item language. C8 gains three distinct warning messages per degradation cause (tag validation, drift, anchor failure). Step 2.5 adds backtick-formatted `original_content` label and naming consistency note.

## Handoff Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-28T14:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Reversed attribute order test scenario not specified (at: TD2, C5, I3)
- [warning] Structural placement of Phase 1/Phase 2 in SKILL.md not cross-referenced (at: File Change Summary, I6)
- [suggestion] C9 step 9 defensive strip ordering not explicit (at: C9)

**Changes Made:**
TD2 gains testing note for reversed attribute order path. File Change Summary cross-references I6 as authoritative structure. C9 step 9 clarified as final operation after all replacements written to output buffer.

## Handoff Review - Iteration 4 - 2026-02-28T14:30:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Testing requirement for reversed attribute order buried in TD2 note rather than acceptance criteria (at: TD2, spec.md AC section)
- [suggestion] Overlapping anchor region degradation has no worked example (at: C9, TD4)

**Changes Made:**
N/A — iteration cap (5/5) reached. Unresolved: reversed-attribute-order test scenario should be captured as a named plan task.

## Handoff Review - Iteration 5 - 2026-02-28T14:35:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Cap reached (5/5) — proceeding with warning

**Unresolved Issues:**
- [warning] Reversed attribute order test scenario buried in TD2 — should be a named plan task or AC
