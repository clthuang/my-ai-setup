# Specification: Promptimize Skill Redesign

## Problem Statement

The `promptimize` skill (`plugins/iflow/skills/promptimize/SKILL.md`) and its command (`plugins/iflow/commands/promptimize.md`) violate four Anthropic prompt engineering best practices identified in the feedback report (`docs/retrospectives/2026-02-28-promptimize-feedback.md`):

1. **God Prompt anti-pattern** — Steps 4-7 (evaluate 9 dimensions, calculate score, generate improved version, generate report) execute in a single LLM pass, risking context degradation and hallucination.
2. **HTML comments instead of XML tags** — Step 6 uses `<!-- CHANGE -->` / `<!-- END CHANGE -->` markers instead of Claude-native `<change>` XML tags.
3. **Math in LLM** — Step 5 asks the LLM to compute `(sum / 27 * 100)`, which is unreliable.
4. **Brittle merge algorithm** — Step 8's "Accept some" logic uses string replacement against LLM-generated boundary markers, which corrupts files when markers are malformed.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Refactor `SKILL.md` to decompose the God Prompt into two chained passes (Grader + Rewriter)
- Replace HTML comment markers with XML tags in the Rewriter output format
- Move score calculation out of the LLM — the orchestrating command computes the final score from raw dimension scores
- Replace the "Accept some" string-replacement merge with an XML-tag-based approach
- Update `commands/promptimize.md` to orchestrate the two-pass flow and perform score calculation
- Update `references/scoring-rubric.md` if structural changes are needed to support the new flow

### Out of Scope

- Changes to `references/prompt-guidelines.md` content (the guidelines themselves are correct)
- Adding new scoring dimensions beyond the existing 9
- Changing the staleness check logic (Step 3)
- Changing the command's interactive file selection (Steps 1-2 of command)
- Changing component type detection logic (Step 1 of skill)
- Changing reference file loading logic (Step 2 of skill)

## Requirements

### R1: Two-Pass Decomposition (Grader + Rewriter)

**R1.1** The skill MUST split the current single-pass Steps 4-7 into two distinct phases:
- **Phase 1 (Grade):** Evaluate 9 dimensions against the scoring rubric. Output ONLY structured JSON with scores, findings, and suggestions per dimension. Phase 1 MUST produce a finding (what was observed) AND a suggestion (what to improve) for each dimension scoring partial or fail. For pass dimensions, suggestion is null.
- **Phase 2 (Rewrite):** Consume the Phase 1 JSON output as context. Generate the improved version of the target file with change markers.

**R1.2** Phase 1 output schema:
```json
{
  "file": "path/to/target.md",
  "component_type": "skill",
  "guidelines_date": "2026-02-24",
  "staleness_warning": false,
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "name": "structure_compliance",
      "score": 3,
      "finding": "Matches macro-structure exactly",
      "suggestion": null,
      "auto_passed": false
    }
  ]
}
```

The `file` and `component_type` fields make Phase 2 handoff fully self-contained per R1.3. The `guidelines_date` and `staleness_warning` fields convey staleness information to the command for report assembly (the skill loads the guidelines file in Phase 1).

**R1.3** Phase 2 MUST reference the Phase 1 JSON produced earlier in the same skill execution, wrapped in a `<grading_result>` XML block. The skill's instructions direct the LLM to first produce Phase 1 JSON, then use that output as context for Phase 2 within the same generation. This is a single skill invocation but with explicitly structured two-phase output — the LLM completes grading before starting the rewrite, using the grading JSON as its own input context. Note: This is a structural decomposition (grading-first ordering with explicit JSON handoff), not an API-call-level decomposition. The LLM produces both phases in one generation, which provides ordering discipline and structured output but does not provide context isolation between phases. Full isolation via two separate skill invocations is out of scope for this iteration.

**R1.4** The report (current Step 7) is generated by the command from the Phase 1 JSON and Phase 2 output — not by the LLM in a third pass.

**R1.5** The skill outputs Phase 1 and Phase 2 results as two clearly delimited sections: Phase 1 JSON wrapped in `<phase1_output>...</phase1_output>` tags, and the rewritten file wrapped in `<phase2_output>...</phase2_output>` tags. The command parses these sections to extract structured data for score calculation and report assembly.

### R2: XML Change Markers

**R2.1** Phase 2 (Rewriter) MUST use XML tags instead of HTML comments:
```xml
<change dimension="token_economy" rationale="Remove redundant preamble">
modified content here
</change>
```

**R2.2** Multi-region changes for one dimension: each region gets its own `<change>` tag with the same `dimension` attribute.

**R2.3** Overlapping dimensions (two dimensions modify the same text): use comma-separated dimension names in the `dimension` attribute:
```xml
<change dimension="token_economy,structure_compliance" rationale="Combined fix">
modified content
</change>
```

**R2.4** Pass dimensions (score=3) MUST NOT have `<change>` tags — their content remains unchanged.

**R2.5** The Phase 2 instructions MUST instruct the LLM to preserve all text outside `<change>` tags byte-identical to the original file. The command verifies this using the context-line matching mechanism from R4.2: for every `<change>` block (treating all dimensions as if selected), locate the corresponding original region via context anchors. Replace each `<change>` block with the matched original text. The result must be byte-identical to the original file (after stripping trailing whitespace per line and ignoring blank-line differences at file boundaries). If not, drift is present. The drift check runs before presenting the approval menu. If drift is detected, the "Accept some" option is removed (only "Accept all" and "Reject" are shown) with a warning explaining why partial acceptance is unavailable. "Accept all" always applies the full Phase 2 output regardless of drift.

### R3: Score Calculation Outside LLM

**R3.1** The LLM MUST NOT compute the overall score. Phase 1 outputs raw integer scores (1-3) per dimension.

**R3.2** The command (`promptimize.md`) computes the overall score: `Math.round((sum of scores / 27) * 100)`.

**R3.3** Auto-passed dimensions contribute a fixed score of 3 to the sum, as currently specified.

### R4: XML-Based Partial Acceptance

> Design note: The feedback report suggested standard diff/patch for partial acceptance. XML tag parsing was chosen instead because it preserves dimension attribution inline and avoids the complexity of generating and applying per-dimension patches in a Markdown-heavy context.

**R4.1** The "Accept some" flow MUST NOT use string replacement against LLM-generated markers.

**R4.2** The merge algorithm is anchored to the original file, not the rewritten file. The "Accept some" flow works as follows:
1. Parse `<change>` XML tags from the Phase 2 output to identify changed regions by dimension. For each `<change>` block, record: (a) the 3 context lines immediately preceding the `<change>` tag (or fewer if near file start), (b) the 3 context lines immediately following the `</change>` tag (or fewer if near file end), and (c) the content between the tags.
2. Present each dimension as a multiSelect option (unchanged from current UX). Overlapping dimensions (comma-separated in the `dimension` attribute per R2.3) are presented as a single inseparable option with all dimension names shown. Selecting or deselecting applies to all overlapping dimensions together.
3. Start from the original file content (`original_content` retained from reference loading).
4. For **selected** dimensions: find the unique occurrence of the before-context + after-context anchor lines in the original file. The original text between those context anchors is replaced with the `<change>` block content. All replacements are computed against the original file simultaneously (not sequentially) to avoid line-offset drift from earlier replacements. If two `<change>` blocks have overlapping context anchor regions in the original file (their 3-line before/after windows intersect), treat the match as non-unique and degrade to Accept all / Reject.
5. If before+after context is not uniquely matched in the original (zero matches, multiple matches, or overlapping anchor regions) for any block, warn the user and degrade to Accept all / Reject.

**R4.3** The command MUST validate `<change>` tag structure before attempting partial acceptance. Validation rules: (1) every `<change ...>` tag has a corresponding `</change>` tag, (2) `<change>` tags are not nested, (3) each `<change>` tag has a non-empty `dimension` attribute, and (4) tag pairs do not overlap with other tag pairs. Use regex-based validation, not a full XML parser, since the tags are embedded in Markdown. If validation fails, degrade to Accept all / Reject with warning.

**R4.4** "Accept all" strips all `<change>` tags and writes the result. No merge logic needed.

**R4.5** If all dimensions score pass (3), Phase 2 output contains no `<change>` blocks. The command displays the report with a 100/100 score and skips the approval menu, displaying: "All dimensions passed — no improvements needed."

### R5: Report Generation

**R5.1** The report template remains the same structure (component type, score, guidelines version, strengths, issues table, improved version).

**R5.2** The report is assembled by the command using:
- Phase 1 JSON for: dimension scores, findings, suggestions, strengths, issues table
- Computed overall score (R3.2)
- Phase 2 output for: the improved version section

**R5.3** Staleness check remains in the skill (Phase 1) and is conveyed to the command via the `guidelines_date` and `staleness_warning` fields in the Phase 1 JSON (R1.2). The token budget check moves to the command: after receiving Phase 2 output, strip all `<change>` and `</change>` tags, count lines and tokens. If the result exceeds 500 lines or 5,000 tokens, set `over_budget_warning = true` and include in the report.

### R6: Backward Compatibility

**R6.1** No backward compatibility required — this is private tooling per CLAUDE.md principles.

**R6.2** The command's external interface (file path argument, interactive selection, AskUserQuestion approval) remains the same.

**R6.3** YOLO mode behavior remains: auto-select "Accept all" in Step 8.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **AC1a:** Running `/iflow:promptimize` on a skill file produces output containing `<phase1_output>` with valid JSON matching the R1.2 schema (exactly 9 dimension entries) and `<phase2_output>` with a complete file containing `<change>` XML tags.
- [ ] **AC1b:** (Code review) The skill's Phase 2 section wraps the Phase 1 JSON in a `<grading_result>` block in its prompt instructions.
- [ ] **AC2:** Given Phase 1 JSON with dimension scores [3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2], the report shows overall score = `Math.round((22/27)*100)` = 81. The score is computed by the command, not present in any LLM output.
- [ ] **AC3:** Given a file with 3 dimensions scoring partial/fail (A, B, C) and Phase 2 output containing `<change dimension="A">`, `<change dimension="B">`, `<change dimension="C">` blocks — when the user selects dimensions A and C in Accept some, the output file contains the modified content from A and C blocks and the original content for the B region, with zero residual `<change>` tags.
- [ ] **AC4:** Malformed `<change>` tags trigger the fallback warning and degrade to Accept all / Reject.
- [ ] **AC5:** "Accept all" produces a clean file with no residual XML tags.
- [ ] **AC6:** Auto-passed dimensions score 3 and have no `<change>` tags in the output.
- [ ] **AC7:** YOLO mode auto-selects "Accept all" without prompting.
- [ ] **AC8:** The staleness check and over-budget warning still function correctly.
- [ ] **AC9:** `./validate.sh` passes after changes.
- [ ] **AC10:** If Phase 2 output has text drift outside `<change>` blocks (differs from original after stripping trailing whitespace per line and ignoring blank-line differences at file boundaries), the command removes the "Accept some" option and warns the user. "Accept all" and "Reject" remain available.

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `plugins/iflow/skills/promptimize/SKILL.md` | Decompose into Phase 1 (Grade) and Phase 2 (Rewrite); replace HTML markers with XML; remove score calculation |
| `plugins/iflow/commands/promptimize.md` | Orchestrate two-pass flow; compute score; assemble report; implement XML-based partial acceptance |
| `plugins/iflow/skills/promptimize/references/scoring-rubric.md` | No changes expected — rubric content is correct |
| `plugins/iflow/skills/promptimize/references/prompt-guidelines.md` | No changes expected |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Phase 2 Rewriter ignores Phase 1 findings | Medium | High | Include Phase 1 JSON as explicit `<grading_result>` XML context block in Phase 2 prompt |
| XML `<change>` tags get mangled by LLM | Low | Medium | Validate well-formedness before merge; fallback to Accept all / Reject |
| Two-pass adds latency | Medium | Low | Acceptable tradeoff for correctness; both passes are fast for single-file review |
| Command becomes too complex with orchestration logic | Medium | Medium | Keep orchestration steps clearly numbered; progressive disclosure pattern for the command |
| LLM drift in unchanged regions breaks partial acceptance | Medium | High | R2.5 drift detection guard; Phase 2 prompt explicitly instructs byte-identical preservation; fallback to Accept all / Reject |

## Dependencies

- None — self-contained within the promptimize skill and command files.
