## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-28T20:20:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [testability] SC-2/AC-8 claim ~28 subjective adjective instances; actual grep returns 73 raw matches (44 agents, 12 commands, 17 SKILL.md files). Work estimate materially wrong. (at: SC-2, AC-8, FR-9)
  Suggestion: Run actual grep and update count
- [blocker] [testability] AC-7 "orthogonal task" undefined — <=3 constraint untestable without definition and enumerated splits (at: AC-7, SC-6)
  Suggestion: Define orthogonal task and enumerate specific splits per command
- [blocker] [assumptions] AC-4/AC-13 behavioral equivalence undefined — "functionally identical" and "equivalent quality" have no verification procedure, despite PRD noting content ordering affects model attention (at: AC-4, AC-13)
  Suggestion: Define concrete comparison procedure
- [warning] [testability] SC-1/AC-1 cache-friendliness behavioral anchors not specified (at: SC-1, AC-1)
  Suggestion: Add Pass/Partial/Fail anchors
- [warning] [assumptions] AC-6/SC-5 contradiction: "zero math" vs secretary "keep if simple enough" (at: AC-6, SC-5)
  Suggestion: Make decision and define trivial-math boundary
- [warning] [scope] AC-5 JSON schema location unclear (command dispatch vs agent file) (at: AC-5, FR-6)
  Suggestion: Clarify coordination between command and agent schemas
- [warning] [testability] AC-3 60-minute time constraint not meaningfully testable (at: AC-3, NFR-1)
  Suggestion: Soften to soft target
- [warning] [clarity] AC-9 terminology convention doesn't cover commands (at: AC-9)
  Suggestion: Extend convention to all component types
- [warning] [traceability] PRD SC about agent caching preservation missing from spec (at: Success Criteria)
  Suggestion: Add SC-10
- [warning] [assumptions] AC-11 hookify mechanism undefined (at: AC-11, SC-8)
  Suggestion: Reference existing hookify plugin

**Changes Made:**
- Updated subjective adjective count from ~28 to ~73 raw matches across 38 files — Reason: blocker 1
- Defined "orthogonal task" and enumerated specific chain splits for both commands — Reason: blocker 2
- Added concrete behavioral equivalence verification procedure to AC-13 with 5-step comparison — Reason: blocker 3
- Added cache-friendliness Pass/Partial/Fail behavioral anchors to AC-1 — Reason: warning 1
- Resolved math contradiction: defined trivial-math exception in SC-5, applied to secretary scoring in AC-6 — Reason: warning 2
- Clarified AC-5 schema goes in command dispatch, must be consistent with agent file — Reason: warning 3
- Softened AC-3 time constraint to soft target with API variance note — Reason: warning 4
- Extended terminology convention in AC-9 to cover commands — Reason: warning 5
- Added SC-10 for agent caching preservation — Reason: warning 6
- Referenced existing hookify plugin in AC-11 — Reason: warning 7
- Scoped AC-10 passive voice verification to promptimize as verifier — Reason: suggestion 1
- Resolved all Open Questions and promoted to Resolved Decisions — Reason: suggestion 3
