# Review History

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-21T01:40:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [assumptions] Feasibility section overstates what is already implemented vs. what requires code changes for the confidence parameter on store_memory (at: Feasibility Assessment, Key Assumptions)
  Suggestion: Distinguish between 'schema supports it' (true) and 'API already exposes it' (false)
- [blocker] [testability] SC-4's 40% injection cap has no specified enforcement mechanism — could be passive monitoring or active pipeline constraint (at: Success Criteria SC-4)
  Suggestion: Clarify whether enforcement is organic via confidence-based ranking demotion or requires pipeline modification
- [blocker] [testability] AC-2's '<10 characters of meaningful content' threshold is ambiguous (at: Acceptance Criteria AC-2)
  Suggestion: Replace with concrete, deterministic rule using stripped input string length
- [warning] [assumptions] AC-3 does not acknowledge that content_hash is exact-match-after-normalization, not semantic similarity (at: AC-3)
  Suggestion: Add note clarifying content_hash is whitespace/case-normalized exact match
- [warning] [traceability] No acceptance criterion tests the <60 character name constraint or defines overflow behavior (at: AC-1)
  Suggestion: Add truncation rule for generated names exceeding 60 characters
- [warning] [testability] AC-11 trigger patterns are inherently LLM-judgment-based and not deterministically testable (at: AC-11)
  Suggestion: Reframe as documentation/content criterion about skill artifact content
- [warning] [scope] Model-initiated capture fallback when MCP is unavailable is unaddressed (at: AC-4, AC-5)
  Suggestion: Add acceptance criterion for model-initiated capture CLI fallback
- [warning] [clarity] Dependencies section understates store_memory changes needed (at: Dependencies)
  Suggestion: Clarify both confidence param addition and /remember passing confidence=low
- [warning] [testability] SC-5 cannot distinguish user-initiated vs model-initiated captures (at: SC-5)
  Suggestion: Accept combined measurement or add distinguishing field

**Changes Made:**
- Feasibility section reworded to distinguish schema support (verified) from API exposure (requires one-line change)
- SC-4 clarified as organic enforcement via confidence-based ranking demotion with monitoring SQL
- AC-2 threshold changed to 20 characters measured on stripped input string
- AC-3 note added about content_hash being exact-match-after-normalization
- AC-1 name constraint clarified with truncation rule
- AC-11 reframed as documentation/content criterion about skill artifact content
- AC-13 added for model-initiated capture CLI fallback when MCP unavailable
- Dependencies section clarified with both changes needed for store_memory
- SC-5 reworded to explicitly cover combined user+model captures
- SC-1 clarified that embedding may occur asynchronously after confirmation
- AC-10 session-start hint given exact text and placement
- Configuration Keys section added with key names, values, defaults, descriptions

## Stage 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-21T01:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (addressed post-approval for polish):**
- [warning] [assumptions] AC-3 dedup hash ambiguity — unclear if user raw text or model-generated description is hashed
  Resolved: Clarified that user's raw free-text IS the description field used for hashing
- [warning] [assumptions] AC-1 reasoning generation not explicitly noted as single inference step
  Resolved: Added note that reasoning is generated in single inference step alongside category/name
- [warning] [clarity] Command implementation type unspecified
  Resolved: Dependencies updated to specify command markdown file with model instructions
- [warning] [assumptions] Feasibility says "one-line change" but two changes needed
  Resolved: Reworded to "two changes: tool signature + _process_store_memory passthrough"
- [warning] [testability] AC-12 category inference is LLM-judgment-based
  Resolved: Added note parallel to AC-11 about heuristic nature and spot-check verification

## Stage 2: Phase Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-21T01:55:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (addressed post-approval for polish):**
- [warning] Problem statement is two sentences, not one
  Resolved: Condensed to single sentence
- [warning] AC-1 missing error path for reasoning generation failure
  Note: Model processes command directly; failure to generate reasoning is not a realistic scenario
- [warning] AC-8 leaks implementation detail (specific CLI path)
  Resolved: Labeled as "reference implementation" detail to distinguish from behavioral requirement
- [warning] AC-2 threshold discrepancy with PRD not called out
  Resolved: Added note explaining threshold change rationale
- [suggestion] SC-4 monitoring SQL is approximation over all-time recall
  Acknowledged: SQL is sufficient proxy for initial release
- [suggestion] AC-10 placement ambiguity between injector and session-start hook
  Resolved: Clarified as session-start hook's build_context() output

## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-21T02:20:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [completeness] C2 confidence parameter plumbing lacked precise interface definitions (at: C2)
  Resolved: I2 already had exact signatures; C2 cross-references I2. Both are now consistent.
- [blocker] [completeness] C1 /remember command validation/inference rules underspecified (at: C1)
  Resolved: Expanded C1 flow with concrete validation rules, category inference signals, name truncation algorithm, description=raw input, and full fallback CLI invocation with explicit source field
- [blocker] [completeness] MCP-to-CLI fallback mechanism not concretely defined (at: C1/C3)
  Resolved: Added full fallback procedure with exact CLI command in C1 and referenced from C3
- [warning] [consistency] CLI fallback must explicitly set source='session-capture' in JSON payload (at: TD-1)
  Resolved: Fallback procedure now includes explicit source field in JSON
- [warning] [assumptions] Budget tracking without infrastructure may degrade in long conversations (at: TD-5)
  Resolved: Added expected degradation note and explicit counter statement instruction
- [warning] [completeness] Session-start hint text already specified in I4 but not cross-referenced in C4 (at: C4)
  Note: C4 includes exact bash line; I4 specifies the same
- [warning] [completeness] Config entries not fully specified in C5 (at: C5)
  Resolved: Added exact DEFAULTS dict entries and template additions with no-additional-validation note
- [warning] [feasibility] Test cases not specific enough in C6 (at: C6)
  Resolved: Added named test functions mapping to AC-9
- [warning] [consistency] Confidence immutable on upsert not documented (at: C2/database)
  Resolved: Added R3 risk noting this behavior and why it's acceptable

**Changes Made:**
- C1 expanded with detailed 9-step flow including validation rules, category inference signals, name truncation algorithm, fallback CLI invocation with explicit source='session-capture'
- C3 trigger patterns enumerated with concrete examples; budget tracking instructions clarified with explicit counter statement
- TD-5 updated with expected degradation note
- R3 added for confidence-on-upsert immutability
- C5 expanded with exact config.py and template changes
- C6 test cases named explicitly
- Build order annotated C4 as parallelizable

## Design Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-21T02:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [consistency] `_process_store_memory` returns same string for new and upsert, but I1 specifies different outputs ("Stored" vs "Reinforced") (at: C2/I1/I2)
  Resolved: Added existence check before upsert in C2; return differentiates "Stored:" vs "Reinforced:" with observation count. C1 step 8 updated to parse return string prefix. Two new test cases added to C6.
- [warning] [consistency] C5 DEFAULTS uses string "5" for budget but _coerce returns int 5 from config file (at: C5/I5)
  Resolved: Changed DEFAULTS to integer `5` with note about type consistency with `_coerce()`
- [warning] [completeness] Model guidance skill (C3) reads config from `iflow-dev.local.md` but model has no mechanism to read files during session (at: C3)
  Resolved: C4 now injects config values into session-start context. C3 updated to read from session context lines instead of file directly.
- [warning] [consistency] Session-start hint placed unconditionally but AC-10 has "memory injection enabled" precondition (at: C4)
  Resolved: C4 documented as unconditional with rationale — /remember and model capture use MCP directly, not the injection pipeline

**Changes Made:**
- C2 now specifies differentiated return: check `db.get_entry(entry_id)` before upsert, return "Reinforced" with observation count for existing entries
- I2 updated with differentiated return code snippet
- C1 step 8 updated to parse store_memory return string prefix
- C5/I5 DEFAULTS budget changed from string "5" to integer 5 with consistency note
- C3 updated to read config from session context (not file)
- C4 expanded to inject memory_model_capture_mode and memory_silent_capture_budget via read_local_md_field
- C4 documented as unconditional with rationale
- I4 updated with full 3-line injection including config values
- C6 added two new test cases for differentiated return
- Dependency graph updated: C4 now depends on C5
- Build order updated: C4 grouped with C3 (both depend on C2, C5)

## Design Review - Iteration 3 - 2026-02-21T02:40:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (addressed post-approval for polish):**
- [warning] [consistency] C2 pre-upsert db.get_entry duplicates the post-upsert get_entry at line 106
  Note: Implementation can optimize by using post-upsert observation_count > 1 check instead
- [warning] [consistency] CLI fallback (writer.py) always returns "Stored:", never "Reinforced"
  Note: Acceptable for v1 — fallback path is rare. Entry still correctly upserted.
- [warning] [completeness] C3 skill has no defensive default for invalid config values
  Note: Will add fallback-to-ask-first instruction in skill content
- [warning] [assumptions] C4 references "line 207" which is brittle
  Note: Implementation will reference by content, not line number
- [warning] [feasibility] C6 test_duplicate_entry_returns_reinforced overlaps with existing test
  Note: Tests coexist — one verifies DB state, other verifies return value

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-21T02:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] C2 confidence validation detail not explicit in Components section
  Resolved: Added exact error message format and cross-reference to I2 code
- [warning] C1 steps 2-4 model-judgment nature not clarified
  Resolved: Added note that steps 2-5 are natural language instructions, model infers in single pass
- [warning] C4 injection location and shell code not precise enough in Components
  Resolved: Changed "after line 207" to "after Available commands line (reference by content)"
- [warning] I1 output variants seem not fully enumerated
  Note: I1 already lists all 4 variants (success, duplicate, too short, error). No change needed.
- [suggestion] C3/C4 co-dependency not noted in dependency graph
  Resolved: Added runtime co-dependency note to build order

**Changes Made:**
- C2 validation step expanded with exact error message and cross-reference to I2
- C2 change #2 now includes docstring update mention
- C1 flow preamble added explaining model inference nature
- C4 changed to reference content rather than line number
- Build order step 4 now notes C3/C4 runtime co-dependency

## Stage 4: Handoff Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-21T02:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** phase-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Issues (addressed post-approval for polish):**
- [warning] Reinforced confirmation format inconsistent across I1, C1 step 8, and I2
  Resolved: Standardized I1 to "observation count incremented" matching C1 step 8
- [warning] I2 get_entry ordering change noted as plan-phase concern
  Note: Implementation detail — plan will handle control flow ordering
- [warning] Domain reviewer's 5 non-blocking warnings carried forward
  Note: Items 1, 3, 5 are acceptable implementation notes, not design gaps
- [suggestion] Existing test_duplicate_increments_observation_count may need assertion update
  Note: Plan phase will address test refactoring alongside C6
