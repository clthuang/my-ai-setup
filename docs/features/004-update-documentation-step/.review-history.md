# Review History: 004-update-documentation-step

## Design Phase

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-29T19:41:40Z

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [warning] Open question from spec not resolved: 'What heuristics determine user-visible changes?' Design states 'Read spec.md to determine if changes are user-visible' but does not specify how to extract/interpret this from the spec. (at: Technical Decisions, Decision 4)
- [note] The Documentation Detector component output shows CHANGELOG.md with 'exists: false' but the design does not mention HISTORY.md as an alternative in the output format, though it's listed in detection targets. (at: Component 1: Documentation Detector, Outputs example)
- [note] The /finish integration interface shows 'y/n/skip' options but behavior for 'n' and 'skip' appear identical. Consider clarifying if these are truly the same or have different semantics. (at: Interfaces, /finish Pre-Completion Check)

**Changes Made:**
1. Added "User-Visible Changes Heuristics" section with indicator table and extraction algorithm
2. Updated output example to include all 5 detection targets (README, CHANGELOG, HISTORY, API, docs/)
3. Simplified y/n/skip to y/n with note explaining declining IS skipping

### Iteration 2 - 2026-01-29T19:45:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] The open questions from spec.md are answered in the design but not explicitly linked back. Minor traceability gap. (at: Previous Issues Addressed section)
- [note] HISTORY.md added as expansion from spec - reasonable as alternative changelog pattern. (at: Component 1: Documentation Detector)

**Summary:** The revised design adequately addresses all three previous issues. Components are clearly defined with interfaces, dependencies are identified, and risks are documented. The Plan phase can proceed with this artifact.

## Plan Phase

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-30T00:00:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Dependency graph showed User-Visible Heuristics as separate node but Phase 2 text says it's inline in /update-docs skill. Minor inconsistency. (at: Phase 2, item 2 and Dependency Graph)
- [note] No time estimates provided - this is intentional per workflow guidance.

**Changes Made:**
1. Clarified dependency graph to show heuristics embedded in /update-docs skill

## Create-Tasks Phase

### Iteration 1 - 2026-01-30T00:02:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Issues:**
- [warning] Task 1.2 used `helpers/` subdirectory but existing skills use `references/`. (at: Task 1.2)
- [warning] Task 3.1 step numbering was confusing - clarified it's new step 4 after existing 3 checks. (at: Task 3.1)
- [note] Task 2.1 referenced "description: (from design)" - inlined the actual description. (at: Task 2.1)

**Changes Made:**
1. Changed `helpers/` to `references/` to match codebase pattern
2. Clarified Task 3.1 step numbering (new step 4 after quality review)
3. Inlined description text in Task 2.1
