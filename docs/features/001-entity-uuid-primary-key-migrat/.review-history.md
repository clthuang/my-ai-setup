## Step 1: Spec-Reviewer Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-03-01T22:00:00+08:00

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] [contradiction] R26 raises ValueError vs AC-11 returns None — contradictory error handling semantics (at: R26, AC-11)
  Suggestion: Clarify per-method error handling — get_entity catches ValueError, others propagate
- [blocker] [missing-requirement] set_parent() must update both parent_type_id and parent_uuid atomically (at: R16)
  Suggestion: Add explicit requirement and AC for dual-column update
- [blocker] [logic-error] register_entity() INSERT OR IGNORE: freshly generated UUID returned but never stored on duplicate (at: R13, C6)
  Suggestion: Add requirement to query existing UUID on duplicate detection
- [blocker] [unjustified-assertion] R31 claims no backfill changes without analysis (at: R31)
  Suggestion: Add explicit analysis of why backfill works unchanged
- [warning] [traceability] No PRD traceability chain documented (at: Problem Statement)
  Suggestion: Add PRD section reference
- [warning] [safety] executescript() auto-commits — breaks transactional migration safety (at: R8)
  Suggestion: Specify conn.execute() instead of executescript()
- [warning] [completeness] Internal CTE queries need explicit enumeration (at: R21)
  Suggestion: List each CTE that needs uuid/parent_uuid migration
- [warning] [testability] AC-25 needs specific verification method (at: AC-25)
  Suggestion: Specify capture-compare approach
- [warning] [testability] AC-7 needs separate INSERT and UPDATE test cases (at: AC-7)
  Suggestion: Split into AC-7a and AC-7b
- [warning] [ambiguity] R20 is vague — which methods change return type? (at: R20)
  Suggestion: Enumerate each method's before/after return type
- [warning] [assumption] C4 idempotency relies on schema_version check — not documented (at: C4)
  Suggestion: Document detection mechanism

**Changes Made:**
- Added PRD traceability paragraph to Problem Statement
- R8: Specified conn.execute() not executescript() for transactional safety
- R12: Split into separate INSERT and UPDATE triggers
- R16: Added "updates BOTH parent_type_id and parent_uuid columns atomically"
- R20: Enumerated each method's return type change explicitly
- R21: Listed specific CTEs (set_parent, get_lineage, _export_tree)
- R22a: Added duplicate handling requirement for register_entity()
- R23: Added lowercase normalization before regex matching
- R26: Documented per-method error handling (get_entity catches, others propagate)
- R31: Added explicit analysis of why backfill works unchanged
- AC-7: Split into AC-7a (INSERT) and AC-7b (UPDATE)
- AC-11: Clarified get_entity catches ValueError
- AC-12: Added dual-column update verification
- AC-15a: Added duplicate detection returns existing UUID
- AC-18: Specified conn.execute() not executescript()
- AC-25: Added verification method (capture-compare)
- AC-27: Expanded to specific test scenarios
- AC-28, AC-29: Added set_parent atomicity criteria
- C3: Added input normalization
- C4: Documented schema_version detection mechanism
- C5: Documented pragma persistence mechanism
