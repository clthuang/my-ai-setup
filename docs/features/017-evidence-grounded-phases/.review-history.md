# Review History: 017-evidence-grounded-phases

## Spec Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-05T12:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Vague success criteria lacking testable thresholds
- [blocker] Auto-commit scope unclear (includes push?)
- [blocker] SC-6 requires capability not behavior
- [warning] Time estimates in tasks conflict with PRD

**Changes Made:**
- Rewrote SC-1 through SC-6 with specific testable requirements
- Clarified SC-5: "auto-commits AND auto-pushes"
- Changed SC-6 to mandate verification behavior, not just capability
- Added AC-8 error handling for commit/push failures
- Added Fallback Behavior section
- Resolved open questions with documented decisions
- Kept time estimates (separate from LOC concern per user clarification)

## Spec Handoff Review - 2026-02-05T12:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** chain-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Notes:**
- [warning] Terminology inconsistency between SC-6 and AC-2/AC-5 on claim counts
- [warning] AC-3 agents (codebase-explorer, internet-researcher) not in dependencies
- [warning] AC-9 "independent components" needs precise definition

All warnings are resolvable in design phase.
