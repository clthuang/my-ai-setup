# Review History: 017-evidence-grounded-phases

## Spec Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-05T12:45:00Z

**Reviewer:** spec-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Vague success criteria lacking testable thresholds
- [blocker] Auto-commit scope unclear (includes push?)
- [blocker] SC-6 requires capability not behavior
- [warning] Time estimates in tasks conflict with PRD

**Changes Made:**
- Rewrote SC-1 through SC-6 with specific testable requirements
- Clarified SC-5: "auto-commits AND auto-pushes"
- Changed SC-6 to mandate verification behavior, not just capability
- Added AC-8 error handling for commit/push failures
- Added Fallback Behavior section
- Resolved open questions with documented decisions
- Kept time estimates (separate from LOC concern per user clarification)

## Spec Handoff Review - 2026-02-05T12:50:00Z

**Reviewer:** chain-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Notes:**
- [warning] Terminology inconsistency between SC-6 and AC-2/AC-5 on claim counts
- [warning] AC-3 agents (codebase-explorer, internet-researcher) not in dependencies
- [warning] AC-9 "independent components" needs precise definition

All warnings are resolvable in design phase.

## Design Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-05T13:25:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] TD-5 evidence citation incorrect - finish.md shows push STOPS, not continues
- [blocker] Stage 0 missing failure handling for research agents
- [blocker] Parallel planning eligibility criteria undefined
- [blocker] Concurrent planning dispatch/merge mechanism undefined

**Changes Made:**
- Fixed TD-5: Changed evidence citation from finish.md to Spec AC-8
- Fixed Component 5: Added Stage 0 failure handling (codebase-explorer/internet-researcher)
- Fixed Component 8: Deferred concurrent planning to future iteration
- Fixed Interface 6: Added .review-history.md to git add list
- Replaced Interface 8: Simplified to research output format (removed parallelPlanning criteria)
- Added "Deferred Features" section documenting AC-9 deferral

## Design Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-05T13:30:00Z

**Reviewer:** design-reviewer (skeptic)
**Decision:** Approved

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- [warning] Interface 5 has time estimate field but spec allows it for tasks (intentional distinction)
- [warning] Interface 6 auto-commit includes .review-history.md which may not exist on first pass
- [warning] Diagram shows +Concurrent but feature is deferred
- [warning] Tool naming may need verification (mcp__context7__ vs mcp__plugin_context7_context7__)
- [warning] Need explicit verification instruction text for reviewers

**Notes:**
- All 4 blockers from iteration 1 were resolved
- Warnings are addressable during implementation

## Design Handoff Review - 2026-02-05T13:40:00Z

**Reviewer:** chain-reviewer (gatekeeper)
**Decision:** Approved

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- [warning] TD-4 defines parallel planning criteria but AC-9 is deferred - minor confusion
- [warning] Interface 8 doesn't show AskUserQuestion format per CLAUDE.md standards

**Notes:**
- All 12 components defined with Purpose, Location, Changes, Inputs, Outputs
- All 8 interfaces specify concrete formats
- Dependencies verified to exist
- Risks identified with mitigations
- Design ready for planning phase

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 1 - 2026-02-05T13:50:00Z

**Decision:** Needs Revision

**Issues:**
- [blocker] Missing TDD test steps before implementation
- [blocker] Auto-commit integration point unclear in existing workflows
- [blocker] Agent tool additions need explicit verification instructions
- [blocker] Stage 0 Research needs state tracking specification

**Changes Made:**
- Added Testing Approach section: plugin modifies markdown, verification steps serve as acceptance tests
- Each command auto-commit now specifies exact step number and placement (e.g., "4b after approval, before state update")
- Agent deliverables now include explicit "MUST verify at least N claims" instruction text
- Design command deliverable now specifies `stages.research` tracking and partial recovery handling
- Added "Blockers Addressed" section documenting all fixes
- Clarified auto-commit includes push per SC-5
- E2E test uses 999- prefix and is deleted after validation

---

## Stage 1: Plan Review - Iteration 2 - 2026-02-05T13:55:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- [warning] WebFetch tool not included for spec-skeptic/design-reviewer (plan-reviewer has it)
- [warning] Design command step numbering "4c" notation needs clarification
- [warning] Stage 0 failure handling should be explicitly referenced in plan deliverable
- [note] Test feature ID 999 is safe but distinctive prefix could be clearer

**Notes:**
- All 4 previous blockers addressed
- Plan ready for chain validation

---

## Stage 2: Chain Review - 2026-02-05T14:00:00Z

**Decision:** Approved

**Warnings (non-blocking):**
- [warning] Component 12 numbering differs between design and plan (expected - plan follows implementation order)
- [note] E2E test failure cleanup not specified
- [note] Tool lists reference "per design" rather than quoting exact list

**Validation:**
- All 12 design components covered in plan ✓
- Skill+agent → command sequencing correct ✓
- All items have Why, Deliverable, Files, Verification ✓
- No LOC estimates ✓
- Ready for task breakdown ✓
