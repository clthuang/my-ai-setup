# Implementation Plan: Evidence-Grounded Workflow Phases

## Overview

This plan implements 12 components across 4 workflow phases (spec, design, plan, tasks) to add reasoning, evidence, and auto-commit capabilities. Implementation follows the phase sequence to ensure each phase's changes can be validated by running the workflow.

**Testing Approach:** This plugin modifies markdown templates and workflow orchestration - not code with unit tests. Verification is done through manual invocation and workflow execution. Each item's verification step serves as the acceptance test.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Spec Phase Enhancements

#### 1.1 Specifying Skill Enhancement
- **Why this item:** Component 1 defines the Feasibility Assessment section template that must exist before reviewers can verify it
- **Why this order:** Skills produce artifacts that reviewers validate; skill must be enhanced first
- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/skills/specifying/SKILL.md` with Feasibility Assessment section template and 2 new self-check items
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/skills/specifying/SKILL.md`
- **Verification:** Run specifying skill manually; verify output includes Feasibility Assessment section with all required fields per Interface 1 in design

#### 1.2 Spec-Skeptic Agent Enhancement
- **Why this item:** Component 2 enables independent verification of feasibility claims using research tools
- **Why this order:** Agent must have tools AND explicit verification instructions before command expects verification results
- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/spec-skeptic.md` with:
  - Tools: `[Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__query-docs]`
  - "Feasibility Verification" category with checklist
  - Explicit instruction: "MUST use Context7 to verify at least one library/API claim OR WebSearch for external claims. Include verification result in output."
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/spec-skeptic.md`
- **Verification:** Invoke spec-skeptic via Task tool with a spec containing a library claim; confirm output includes "Verified: {claim} via {source}" or "Unable to verify independently"

#### 1.3 Specify Command Auto-Commit and Push
- **Why this item:** Component 12 adds auto-commit AND auto-push after phase-reviewer approval for specify command
- **Why this order:** Command enhancement depends on skill and agent being ready to produce valid artifacts
- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/commands/specify.md` with step "4b. Auto-Commit Phase Artifact" inserted AFTER phase-reviewer approval (Step 4) and BEFORE state update (Step 5), containing:
  - `git add docs/features/{id}-{slug}/spec.md docs/features/{id}-{slug}/.meta.json docs/features/{id}-{slug}/.review-history.md`
  - `git commit -m "phase(specify): {slug} - approved"`
  - `git push`
  - Error handling per Interface 6: commit failure blocks, push failure warns but continues
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/commands/specify.md`
- **Verification:** Run `/iflow-dev:specify` on test feature; verify git log shows commit and remote has push after approval

---

### Phase 2: Design Phase Enhancements

- **Complexity:** Medium (template changes affect output structure)
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/skills/designing/SKILL.md`
- **Verification:** Run designing skill manually; verify output includes Prior Art section with Research Conducted table and enhanced Technical Decisions with all required fields

#### 2.2 Design-Reviewer Agent Enhancement
- **Why this item:** Component 4 enables independent verification of design claims
- **Why this order:** Agent must have verification capabilities before design command expects verification results
- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/design-reviewer.md` with:
  - Tools: `[Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, mcp__context7__query-docs]`
  - "Prior Art Verification" and "Evidence Grounding" categories
  - Explicit instruction: "MUST independently verify at least 2 claims using Context7/WebSearch/Grep. Include verification evidence in review output."
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/design-reviewer.md`
- **Verification:** Invoke design-reviewer via Task tool with design containing library claims; confirm output includes 2+ verification results

#### 2.3 Design Command Enhancement
- **Why this item:** Component 5 adds Stage 0 Research before architecture and auto-commit after approval
- **Why this order:** Command orchestrates skill and agent; must be updated last in phase
- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/commands/design.md` with:
  - Stage 0 (Research) inserted BEFORE Stage 1 (Architecture)
  - New stage tracking: `stages.research: { started, completed }` in .meta.json
  - Failure handling: if codebase-explorer/internet-researcher fail, note "unavailable" in Prior Art section and proceed
  - User skip option: "Skip (domain expert)" bypasses Stage 0 entirely
  - Partial recovery: if `stages.research.started` exists but not `completed`, offer resume/restart
  - Auto-commit step "4c. Auto-Commit Phase Artifact" after handoff review approval
- **Complexity:** Medium (new stage with agent dispatch and state tracking)
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/commands/design.md`
- **Verification:** Run `/iflow-dev:design` on test feature; verify .meta.json shows `stages.research` timestamps and git log shows commit after approval

- **Deliverable:** Updated `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/plan-reviewer.md` with:
  - "Reasoning Verification" category checking Why fields exist and reference design/dependencies
  - Challenge pattern: if LOC found → "Replace with deliverable - what artifact proves completion?"
  - Challenge pattern: if Why missing → "Why needed? Which design requirement?"
- **Complexity:** Simple
- **Files:** `plugins/iflow-dev/agents/plan-reviewer.md`
- **Verification:** Invoke plan-reviewer on plan with LOC estimate; verify it flags as issue with "Replace with deliverable" suggestion

## Risk Mitigations Applied

- **Parallel execution within phases:** Items 1.1/1.2, 2.1/2.2, 3.1/3.2, 4.1/4.2 can be done in parallel
- **Validation checkpoints:** Each phase has verification criteria before moving to next
- **Incremental testing:** Skills tested before agents before commands
- **Test feature cleanup:** E2E test uses `999-` prefix and is deleted after validation

## Blockers Addressed

1. **TDD Order:** This plugin modifies markdown templates, not code. Verification steps serve as acceptance tests.
2. **Auto-commit integration:** Each command specifies exact step number (e.g., "4b") and placement (after approval, before state update).
3. **Agent verification instructions:** Each agent deliverable now includes explicit "MUST verify" instruction text.
4. **Stage 0 state tracking:** Design command deliverable specifies `stages.research` tracking and partial recovery handling.
