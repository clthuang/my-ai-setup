## Known Anti-Patterns

### Anti-Pattern: Working in Wrong Worktree
Making changes in main worktree when a feature worktree exists.
- Observed in: Feature #002
- Cost: Had to stash, move changes, re-apply in correct worktree
- Instead: Check `git worktree list` at session start; work in feature worktree if one exists

### Anti-Pattern: Over-Granular Tasks
Breaking a single file modification into many small separate tasks.
- Observed in: Feature #003
- Cost: Initial 31 tasks had to be consolidated to 18 during verification
- Example: 4 tasks for one skill file (create structure, add sequence, add validation, add patterns)
- Instead: One task per logical unit of work (one file = one task, or one component = one task)

<!-- Example format:
### Anti-Pattern: Premature Optimization
Optimizing before measuring actual performance.
- Observed in: Feature #35
- Cost: 2 days wasted on unnecessary caching
- Instead: Measure first, optimize bottlenecks only
