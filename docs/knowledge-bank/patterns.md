## Development Patterns

### Pattern: Context7 for Configuration Verification
Use Context7 to look up Claude Code documentation before guessing configuration syntax.
- Used in: Feature #002
- Benefit: Discovered correct hooks auto-discovery path (plugin root, not .claude-plugin/)
- Avoided: Wrong fix that would have required later correction

### Pattern: Follow Skill Completion Guidance
Read skill completion messages for the correct next step instead of guessing.
- Used in: Feature #002
- Benefit: Skills define the workflow; following them ensures consistency
- Example: designing skill says "Run /create-plan" not "/create-tasks"

<!-- Example format:
### Pattern: Early Interface Definition
Define interfaces before implementation. Enables parallel work.
- Used in: Feature #42
- Benefit: Reduced integration issues by 50%
