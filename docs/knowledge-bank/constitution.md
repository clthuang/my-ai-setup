# Engineering Constitution

Core principles governing all work. Updated through retrospectives.

## Immutable Principles

### 1. KISS — Keep It Simple, Stupid
The simplest solution that works is the best solution.

### 2. YAGNI — You Ain't Gonna Need It
Don't build what isn't needed. Speculation is waste.

### 3. Delete > Deprecate
Remove unused code. Don't preserve dead paths.

### 4. Tests Guarantee Compatibility
Not backwards-compat hacks. Tests verify behavior.

### 5. Evidence Before Assertion
Verify, don't assume. Run the test. Check the output.

<!-- Example format:
### From Feature #42: User Auth
- Session tokens over JWTs for simple auth (less complexity)
- Always validate on backend even if frontend validates
